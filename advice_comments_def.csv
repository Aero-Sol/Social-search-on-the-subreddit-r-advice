1,1izle46_mf3whj8,"So my dad bailed when I was only a year old. I didn't meet him until I was 16. And ONLY because his father had had an estranged daughter who wanted nothing to do with him because he had walked out. It was his dying wish to meet me. And see my dad meet me.

I moved in with him at 18, trying to get to know him. He got tired of parenting about 3 months in, locked my cell phone in his gun safe then had me use my own money to buy a $500 last minute plane ticket back to my mom's so he could be done. (Mind you he made me basically be his live in maid he just didn't like a friend of mine and blew up) (Edit: ironically because he thought it was creepy I was hanging out, as friends, with someone 30, who I met through work, read the below comments to see the irony)

When I was 22, he told me he had a rare form of cancer and asked me to take care of him. I dropped everything and went to Texas to do so. It included cleaning up his literal shit off the ground, and helping him get diapers. The man who literally never changed my diaper. He got better 3 months later and relearned to walk. As soon as he was better he and his wife changed the locks, called my job to get me fired and offered me a plane ticket home or $400. Their reasoning this time? I had taken a boyfriend and would stay at his house most nights. (I would be awake at 5 am, go to his house tend to him like a nurse/maid from 6:30am to 5 pm while my step mother worked.) 

He's never apologized for this. 
He got sick again in 2020, I was in my 30s at that point. I have a kid. His wife cheated and left him while he was in the hospital. 

But theres no way I would ever drop anything to save him again. 

Deadbeats gonna deadbeat. I felt like I would feel guilty and like I missed out on a chance to get to know him. I would have saved myself a HUGE amount of trauma, trouble, an abusive relationship because of sudden homelessness when my bf and I broke up due to the pressure of suddenly living together. It's simply not worth it. Men like him are narcissistic users who will drop you the moment they no longer see you as useful. You don't owe the man who literally brought you into the world and had a true responsibility to care for you, then didn't because of selfishness the level of care he never gave you.",33,4,1740679327.0,8067.0,35002.0

The question really is, is there anything you will feel is unfinished business if you decide not to engage in his end of life care.

If there is, is it worth the effort he is asking you to make.  Is he asking you to be a caregiver? 

That's what it sounds like.  Frankly, I'd be a big ""fuck, no"" on that score.  I might consider an occasional visit, if I felt it would give me what I wanted.

**He made his decision 15 years ago.  He decided he wanted to go it alone.  This is a consequence of that decision HE made.**

This decision is entirely yours, based on what YOU want and need at this point in your life.

Again, YOU OWE HIM NOTHING.

10,1izle46_mf3sxto,"My mom did something similar to me. We were estranged for 16 years.  I always told her very kind sister that if the time came and she needed care due to health/dementia or whatever else, though I had a lot of resentment, I would help by stepping so that the burden was not all on her.  

That time came a little over 2 years ago. It was super hard at first. I am the only child and we live in separate states.  The worse the dementia and incapacitation has gotten, the easier it has become to deal with her. She seems to have lost the mean, manipulative and narcissistic side for the most part‚ÄîI never thought I would see a better side of my mom through dementia? But here we are!   It‚Äôs not always awesome. But it makes doing the humane thing for her easier.  I found a good assisted living place who treats her very well and it is working out.   

Do I still have my resentment and anger toward the abuse she threw at me for decades, absolutely.  But I have put it aside for now and just do the job that needs doing. Sometimes it‚Äôs even pleasant. I think I will be glad that I at least got a little time with a kinder mother due to dementia. Silver linings.",49,7,1740678330.0,8067.0,1109.0

Hell, our professor would check her phone and even make calls occasionally mid-class as she was looking after her elderly parents. Everyone understood. A few students had to leave or arrive at odd times because they had children, and shit happens with childcare. If you didn't complete practice coursework, there wasn't any penalty either, as only assessments are graded. You're only hurting yourself, at the end of the day. As long as you weren't attempting to use your phone in a closed book assessment, there was no issue whatsoever.

I watched my fianc√© with my son and saw reasons why he might have been struggling and then spoke to him about it.

Try to frame it as helping them for the sake of their health, jobs, and school reputations. A lot of us parents did stupid things when we were young too, so just remember that it could be worse.

However, where she really crosses the line is how she is attempting to rewrite who your brother was. She can bury your brother catholic, but she doesn't get to pretend this is who he was. Oh, he became a covert and decided he believed all the things your mom wanted him to and wanted all the things your mom wanted for him, and only your mom witnessed it? That's convenient.

AND THEN she fucking tells you that you that you can't be part of the funeral unless you accept her bullshit as truth and accept jesus into your heart or whatever. That is unforgivable. 

I would write her a letter. Tell her that you get why she wants to bury your brother catholic, but that you don't buy for a second that he converted. The fact that she would lie about him and who he was is disgusting to you. And the fact that she would use this occasion to cooerce you to swallow her lies and participate in her religion is absolutely abhorrent. Let her know that this has affected the way you see her and that this has damaged your relationship with her probably beyond repair. Ask her if having her way is worth losing her other son.

Honestly this isn't an uncommon situation at all.  Unfortunately I've been to A LOT of funerals in my time and I can't think of a single one that wasn't religious based.

Its 4 years difference, problem is the male was a Teachers' Assistant. He promised me he wouldn't do anything, but I told him I wouldn't let anyone know if he quit and left the 12-13 year old alone, and our program alone. He called me begging and sobbing too let it be and that he wouldn't do anything. I held strong and said if he didn't quit I would inform the Program Director. He resigned the next day. 

It was the power dynamic that was problematic. Even if this 18 year old male was participating as a student and they met that way, they wouldn't have interacted due to how we divide based on age groups. 

Years later he got in contact with me and let me know that he eventually told his parents who encouraged him to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bi-polar disorder. He is doing much better now and realises what was wrong in that situation. 

The 12-13 year old is 17 now and works for me as a Teachers' Assistant.

Don't hate yourself. That's what's going to make you believe you're unlovable. Instead, forgive yourself. Take it as an opportunity to learn from, even if you still regret it. Because again, we all have done things we regret, and there's worse things than what you did.

As for dating -- don't feel compelled to bring this up in a first date, or even a second or third one. The first few times you date someone, it's to get to know one another, the good parts of one another. Almost no one is ready to deal with the worst of another person in the first date. If you bring it up, I guarantee 99% of the time, you'll scare them off. This will be something you talk about when you're in a deeper relationship. And it will be a tough pill to swallow, for both of you. But if you meet someone who loves you for who you are, they may get mad for awhile, but they'll love and ultimately accept that you are an imperfect person, just as they are, and you'll grow together.

In the Bible, Jesus even forgave a prostitute of her sins and shortcomings. He could just as easily forgive you. If the Bible teaches us that the God of the universe can forgive you for messing up, then you have the ability to forgive yourself.

346,1h6fanr_m0efxi5,"Hi OP, sorry you're getting so much blowback about your mom when you're asking about your dad and you're also a victim in this.

Am I correct that you and your sister are not twins and so this was easily an affair of years?

I agree with commenters who say two weeks is too short a time to expect him to unclench from this shock. Not only has most if his life been based on a lie but his future is also shattered at a time of life when he surely spends a lot of time thinking about retirement and sunset years with your mom.

So given all of that, he is arguably doing very well if he is eating at all and actually continuing to go to work. No doubt that routine is one of his most significant salvations.

I'm not even sure what more you want from him.

If you need assurance that he'll still be your dad, write him a physical note and ask him for that assurance. Appealing to his sense of duty as a father may be the one reflex that can penetrate his despair.

Presumably you are getting therapy for yourself over this? I would share that process with him. I don't know why, but I really feel like a written note is the best means of communication when he is this closed off. Hey Dad, I started therapy to help deal with what has happened to us [I would emphasize that it has happened to you both] and the therapist says the first step is for me to xyz.""

I assume what he is experiencing is akin to grieving a death, but maybe there is even more specific counsellingbyiu can consult.

I would just share this as a daughter sharing with her dad, not that you're telling him what to do or how to cope. Just show him the example and maybe he can take something from it. And at least he'll be having human contact if he wants it.

Again, I think as a father he will have an automatic concern and interest in your well being, so he's more likely to care about how you're doing than he will want to talk about himself. Maybe it'll take him a while to get to your note or to get through your note as he retreats to whatever spiral he's stuck in.

And you should probably also be prepared for him to have a bad reaction to outreach. Maybe he'll tell you to fuck off, to leave him alone. It might take a few tries for him to even be receptive. 

He seems strong from your description that he is even functioning at all, but he could be forgiven for having a selfish perspective or an angry perspective or a resentful perspective. Maybe he wonders if you knew. Humiliation is surely part if the spectrum of emotions he's facing.

I wonder if there is something to be explored in his retreating to the basement. If there was somewhere else he could stay for a bit, would he accept? I would hate for him to take the offer of a place to stay as a suggestion that not only is his family not his but he should leave his own house. 

At the same time, everything around him is probably a painful reminder and a betrayed memory, so maybe he would recognize the relief of staying in a neutral place if you can think of what that might be.

I have no expertise. I'm basically just brainstorming, but hopefully you can find a useful nugget in here and know that at least one internet stranger takes your distress seriously.

415,1gm31hl_lvzez27,"You say that flirting is naturally part of his personality. That may be true, but part of maturing is understanding appropriate behavior, and not crossing the line from friendly to flirting. It's frankly disrespectful both to you and to the women he is potentially flirting with. It also means recognizing when situations are inappropriate and risk temptation. In this case, it seems like excessive alcohol in a bar with female friends ended up with this result. It is each partner's responsibility (not yours!) to avoid situations where things may ""just happen."" That could look like, for example, limiting his drinks to one or two in that situation.

It is a good sign that he told you about it immediately, and it seems as though he is genuinely sorry. One kiss itself isn't really the concern (although of course it is very painful for you). I would be more concerned about him reflecting a bit deeper about why it happened. The truth is that since you starting dating at such a young age, you didn't get to separately experience dating around and having many of these kinds of experiences, so there may be some growing pains that go along with this type of relationship. It's hard for any of us to fully understand what we're committing to in ""death do us part,"" but it is especially difficult for young people, I think.

I would tell her behavior doesn‚Äôt make you feel safe or secure in the relationship. 

I would tell her that if she is going to act this way towards you, you are going to have to take steps to protect yourself emotionally. That might mean (fill in the blank), whatever that looks like for you. 

Whatever you do, don‚Äôt stuff this down and ignore it. That will destroy the intimacy in your marriage. I would recommend a book called Boundaries in Marriage by Henry Cloud. It can help with having these difficult conversations.",14,0,1730232387.0,6499.0,1614.0

Thought about making a throwaway for this but I won‚Äôt. 

It never hurts to say it too much- you did right by calling 911.

I work with older adults who in their distant pasts performed violent and inappropriate acts on animals and other people. Part of my job is cultivating emotional distance from what I would otherwise find horrifying. I do this so I can work with people on therapeutic goals- or just not being dangerous to themselves or others. I could not do this as a family member. 

I say this because I‚Äôm going to echo what others have said here: it is imperative you consider what you want your role in your brothers support system to be. You may not want to have a role at all, and that‚Äôs fine. If I were you I would have that conversation with your parents. I would also cover what plans they have for your brother after they pass or become incapable of caring for him. 

If I can give you any hope- the people I work with no longer are dangerous to themselves or others. They live in places where they are supported, have friends, are involved in the community in healthy ways and lead lives as fulfilling as we can help them to be.

486,1hss60e_m590di8,"I thought I'd comment as a dad (M40) to our first daughter (7 months old today).

Your husband's behaviour in all sorts of ways is simply UNACCEPTABLE.  

Our girl has had many periods of being quite mum-dependent and was also exclusively breast-fed until the age of 7 months.  For a man I admit I did find this difficult period in knowing what to do and/or bond with our daughter.  When it came to feeding I took the opportunity whenever my wife was feeding to get any and all household chores done including doing anything I could think to help my wife and meal-prep is a prime example of this.  If your baby won't take a bottle and is only breast-feeding then your husband should be helping/contributing in another way.

I know a lot of people including friends with babies have a mentality of the ""man needs to go to work so he needs his full rest etc."" but I'm definitely of the opinion after seeing what my wife puts in that looking after my daughter while I'm at work is just as if not more intense as a day of work.  As such I believe that the working person should be putting in just as much time and effort to parent outside of work.  

For the first 3 months I couldn't help with breast-feeding at night but at night I could help with post-feeding settling or settling in general.  Or even just as simple as lifting our sleeping daughter from my wife's lap to her cot.  Yes it meant we were both sleepy but I felt it was important to be there to support my wife whatever.

I believe in particular the dozens and dozens of hours of getting our daughter settled has in itself created a close bond between us.  It was hard particularly early on dealing with her being upset for so long when settling.  However a bond is created the most important thing is time.  Your husband only spending an hour with your child isn't going to help much with them being mum-dependent.  It may be difficult but he needs to spend more time together, even if its with the three of you.

To me it sounds like your husband is both entitled and lazy and he needs to step up and be a real man and put in the effort that is required to be a dad.  

The water and waking though does cross the line to abuse and he needs to be told as such and if nothing changes he should leave.",21,0,1735939952.0,3860.0,4271.0

You are amazingly strong for hanging in there this long. I hate to say it but I do think you need to call someone. Do you have grandparents that are decent people, who you can trust? Meaning - they treat you very well, you know them well, they have no drug/alcohol problems, they have regular income, a decent home, etc? If so, you need to call them. They should be furious. If not or when you do call them, they aren't furious and extremely concerned about what's going on then you most certainly need to call the police. Your parents have abandoned you. Your grandparents or a trusted relative should immediately attempt to get custody of you two and protect you. Anything less than that is not acceptable. 

Making matters worse they are not telling you why. This is never ok. Never. Do they have drug problems? It sounds like they may. That or they decided to take a vacation without kids and just dropped this on you and won't say why so you don't tell anyone --since they know it's wrong (I've heard of people doing that before and being arrested for it).

You need to file a police complaint today by Monday at the latest for harassment based on  Mick Myrtle and the other false reviews  so all this is documented to protect you from any future false charges from her like claiming rape or assault when she is exposed. You file it either in person at a police station  or by mailing a certified US mail letter to head of  the local police: police Chief/Commissioner/Sheriff. Include a line that says certified number \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in the letter and write the number on it. Save the certified number for your records. Here is a business letter format if needed [https://templates.office.com/en-us/Formal-business-letter-TM00002133](https://templates.office.com/en-us/Formal-business-letter-TM00002133)  Print the letter at friends home or library so she cannot see it on a your phone/computer. Once there is a criminal complaint all of those reviews can be traced back to her phone. Include the fact you traced Mick Myrtle in the complaint.

You should very quietly prepare to leave When you do tell her your leaving have witnesses present so she does not falsely accuse you of hitting her.

You should check on r/legaladvice if you can get an order of protection in your state based on simple harassment. Which would force her to move out instead of you

But staying is not an option unless you want her ruining the rest of your life. Spend the time NOW changing everything on your phone/computers etc so she has no access.

A young woman with whom I used to work and hang out with, had something similar happen to her.  

Everywhere she worked it seemed, she would get fired with no real explanation.  Her tires were cut on several occasions, she would get phone calls in the middle of the night - one after the other - with nobody on the other end and was kicked out of 2 apartments because someone anonymously called and said she was selling drugs.  

This,  along with many other things,  like being forced off of the road in her car, drove her to attempt suicide.  

Every time she would just start getting back on her feet, something else would happen to knock her down, or something traumatic would happen that would almost cost her her life. 

Our company took a chance on her and gave her a job and she's been with us for 10 or 12 years now.

Now, before all of this started happening, she had a less than desirable type of boyfriend.  Possessive, clingy, and controlling.  She ended up getting back together with this sop after coming to work for us.  

She later found out (I don't know how, or know all of the details) that the young man had taken a $1M life insurance policy out on her.  It was later discovered that he was the one messing with her life and driving her to the extreme actions she took.  

I don't know if he admitted to it, or what the whole story was.  I do know that she found the policy as they were moving back in together, and through some miracle from above, she's alive and he's in prison.

607,toq8ob_i277izv,"This is uh, a very interesting situation, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with it. 

So, first, I want to mention that I think your husband has an obsessive/addictive personality, and the reasons you probably haven‚Äôt seen it is because people with an addictive personality cling onto very random things once they find they have a ‚Äúpassion‚Äù for it. My late father got addicted to opioids (again, it happened on and off) in his last year of life, and on top of that, got obsessed with old technology and went on a ton of shopping sprees to fix up some old Apple computers he had. 

The reason why I put ‚Äúpassion‚Äù into quotes is because they see it as such, but for everyone else, it‚Äôs much more. Your husband likely doesn‚Äôt know the extent of all of this, and why it is so detrimental to your marriage. As one commenter put it, it would be best to set up an intervention, but look into some specifics about impulsive buying and obsessive behavior first. A lot of the time, the underlying factors of overindulgence is because of depression or anxiety. Remember, we‚Äôre still in a society where it‚Äôs not 100% okay for men to admit they need psychological help amongst their peers, so reassure him that you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs weak for being obsessive, but that you‚Äôre worried about him and about your relationship.

Finally, OP, I think it‚Äôs going to be hard to just get rid of this band from your life. If your husband likes them, then that‚Äôs good, he just needs to learn to manage how involved he is with them. Buying merch, whatever. Spending thousands you don‚Äôt have on old merch you don‚Äôt need, definitely bad.

*Before* you tell your parents you need to have proof of what she's doing, like copies of those videos. The reason for this is that psychopaths are expert liars, and experts at manipulating people. If you tell your parents without proof it's your word against hers, and she'll probably just talk her way out of it. In fact, she'll probably turn the tables on you and insist you're the villain for violating her privacy and looking through her phone. 

If that happens, she deletes the videos, she knows she's been found out, and she makes even more efforts to hide what she's doing. Also psychopaths are notoriously vindictive, and she may fuck up your life for years to come. Things like framing you for a crime 3 years from now, spreading rumor about you to your friends and contacts on social media, catfishing you on social media, getting you fired from your job if you have one.

Killing small animals (with no purpose and keeping recordings of your SADISTIC methods) is a definite sign that someone is taking actual pleasure from harming living creatures. These animals are small and helpless against her, it feels good for her to kill them for that very reason. It gives a sense of power.

This is SERIOUS. You need to tell not just your family, but report this to the authorities. She needs serious mental help before this can spread. But more importantly, you need to do your best to keep her from knowing. Don't leave your phone or computer unlocked, and try to keep yourself as anonymous as possible when reporting her. Team up with your family and keep an EXTREMELY close watch on her. Because if she realizes that you're ratting her out (yes, rat as in the things she's likely killed more than once) then you may end up her first human victim.

Please be careful OP, but do not let your feelings for your family blind you to the clear signs of what's going on. Do not let attachment excuse the actions of someone who is very seriously ill and can become a danger to society as a whole.

He may genuinely not remember much, but he can't firmly say it's not true if he doesn't remember much.

The fact is that you're pretty much definitely never going to know for sure. If it makes you uneasy, it's probably best to take this off ramp, even if there's the possibility it's not fair to him.

You have to decide for yourself whether you think it's true or not and if you do, you then need to decide if the specific situation he was involved in rises to what you consider a deal breaker.

I'm not entirely sure how that kind of thing goes, but if there's a police report that he has access to, I would recommend asking him for it (Because you presently only have his side of the story) and then making your decision from there.",52,0,1735403173.0,1986.0,21578.0

I think the best thing to do is talk to a professional and if you do decide to tell your partner, you can plan it with your therapist and prepare for your partners reaction ahead of time. Or, alternatively, they can help you sort through your feelings of shame and guilt privately without telling your partner.

I don't think there is a right or wrong answer here, but if it were me, I wouldn't want to keep this from my partner and I would not want to get married until I sorted out my feelings on the matter. Not because of any moral reason, but because I wouldn't want to always wonder if they would still accept me and love me. But that's not how everyone feels and that's okay.

It is a painful thing, to keep your past from the person you are supposed to be able to trust the most.

due to comments saying that it is low chance because he is ""undetectable"" My comment is bias because i am assuming because he was a young man on the phone in a panic response is probably lying about it. Maybe he was telling the truth, maybe not. but he was already lying about the hiv thing so that lead me to also believe he is lying about being undetectable. 

also if he is not lying about that, because he is a young man, see them as not responsible as adults in terms of taking medications on time every single time. just missed meds creates a transmission window, so we do not know if this has ever occured.

862,1fmjm2x_loccb76,"People are being really harsh in the comments, and I saw your response about only being 20, my parents were only 18 when they had me and it was a lot for them. I can imagine being 20 doesn‚Äôt change very much as it‚Äôs only a two year difference.

I think whatever choices you make depend on what path you‚Äôre on right now in life. If you are working or if you are attending school.

If you are solely working, then you‚Äôll need to figure out a way to financially advance yourself to such a degree that you can atleast send some kind of assistance to your daughter and be there for her physically on occasion abroad.

Your other option is, if you‚Äôre in school, finish your schooling as quickly as possible and do your best to find a program in Korean that allows you to work and provide for your child. This may look like teaching English predominantly, but perhaps if you strive for getting a graduate degree over there and learn the language over time this could change.

If you make these decisions NOW and start planning NOW you can be there for your child during their childhood. Maybe not a ton at first because these things take time, but you need to legally establish rights, ties, and provide evidence that this child is also yours.

Your other option other than going to SK, is after she gets through her pregnancy and recovers, you can start the discussion with her now of coming to the US if she is interested in that idea.

You can get married to her, and figure out a way to get her citizenship. There‚Äôs a way you can get a green card going I believe pretty early, but you might want to look into speaking to an immigration lawyer first and see what they say about everything.

Lastly, I would like to say to you that YES this is a lot, and YES you are young, but this isn‚Äôt the end of your life unless you make it that way. You have to decide for yourself whether you want to live with the guilt of not being there for your child and the mother of your child FOREVER, or as others have mentioned ‚Äúfigure it out!‚Äù 

It‚Äôs a lot to figure out though, and I‚Äôm sorry that things will be a bit confusing for quite awhile. If you like this girl, and find her attractive, kind, and that she already cares for this child, then maybe you should make the effort to try and develop a loving relationship with her. This may not be possible at first totally due to whatever stress you feel, but I think if you put in some effort, you‚Äôll find that it‚Äôs not that hard to learn to love someone that is good and kind. 

Even if all of this doesn‚Äôt work out, and in the end you do spend some time away from your child and visits happen on occasion, remember that you have a baby and she is waiting for you and will be looking for you for the rest of her life if you aren‚Äôt there.

Fate really works in mysterious ways, and sometimes your swimmers work better than you ever imagined! But this is why it is important to use protection. I am pregnant presently and it was COMPLETELY unplanned and I am not that much older than you, it happens to the best of us.

You CAN DO THIS! 

You CAN figure this out.

And I think if you do work hard and do put your best foot forward and think of this woman and child truly as your own to support and protect you will make the right decisions as they come.

Wishing you the best! Be kind to yourself and be soft, don‚Äôt go crazy, and DO find someone to talk to in RL about your problems, preferably someone with a degree mental health or someone reliable and wiser.üòÖ",17,3,1727000908.0,1416.0,1050.0

The police should keep you anonymous in this situation, but be prepared for retaliation in this scenario anyway, since their child will know your son took the video. Consider security cameras on your property, at the bare minimum. 

As far as your son, taking away electronics and social media and grounding him indefinitely is the bare minimum. I would even go so far as to consider sending him to a different school. It is likely that when the school gets wind of this, he may be expelled and sent to an alternative school anyway. Expect resistance. Get him to a psychiatrist ASAP. That being said, talk to him and see if he can even explain to you why he did this. I mean, if the kid did something terrible to them, or he raped a girl or something, your son still did wrong but in his mind he may have been enacting justice.

Consent is everything because everyone should have the right to decide what sexual acts or activities they take part in and badgering women with unwanted and unsolicited pictures of his penis isn't just illegal it's disrespectful and it's taking away their choice.

899,g330qs_fnqk83w,"Hi! Pediatrician here! In addition to all the replies about getting her to an abortion appointment, you should also take her to a pediatrician ASAP if she doesn't have one already. Even with COVID, if you explain the situation, they'll likely see her in the office. Reason being, this kind of risk taking behavior (not just the sex but the drugs and alcohol) is out of the norm even for ""bad kids"" and she should have and really would benefit from actual behavioral therapy going forward in her life, which is more involved than ""just"" the emotional/psychological counseling that everyone is mentioning elsewhere (definitely agree with that suggestion, as well). I don't know where you live so I don't know what you have access to and your health insurance status, but if you can take her to a larger peds practice that has social workers and/or community behavioral health (CBH) resources and referrals, that would be ideal. There's also a whole world within what we call CBH called ""trauma informed"" counseling or therapy. They specifically focus on children who have experienced adverse childhood events (ACEs), of which it sounds like Chloe has had many, unfortunately. The number of ACEs a child has had in their life significantly correlates with all kinds of bad life circumstances in adulthood, like higher rates of domestic violence, alcohol and drug abuse, and low socio-economic status. BUT it's been shown that intervening early, i.e., with behavioral health and trauma-focused counseling, significantly decreases the likelihood of these things.

A really, really, really great website is [cap4kids.org](https://cap4kids.org) \-- created by a pediatrician -- they have all kinds of resources pertaining to the above listed by city. If your city isn't listed, you can go to one nearby and see if they have referrals or info for your area.

First of all if you see the van again don't open the door at all in any circumstance.  Make sure that you take precautions and make sure everything is locked every time you get home.  Have a phone close to you at all times.  Its great that you took a picture(I'm assuming from your cell phone)!  Call the non emergency line and let them know whats going on and show them the picture when they come.  Also talk with your parents and show them the picture.  Be very serious and let them know your concern(if it's something you can talk with your parents about).

Even so,  every time the van comes up try to take a picture from inside your place.  If its 2 days in a row you do it both days....but do it from inside your house. Try to do it as best as you can without them noticing it.  Your cellphone will have the date and time of the picture.  If it happens 3 times max, call the cops(unless its truly an emergency then call them immediately).  Show them through those pictures that they have indeed been coming all this time.   Don't risk going outside to get any licence plate info.  You stay in your house with the phone ready.

With those pictures the cops will know the date and the time to really track these guys down.

Just in case have a plan.  If they where to break in what would you do?  Do you have a place you can lock yourself in or hide(as you call and wait for the cops)?  It's scary to think about,  but mentally having a plan will make you feel a little more confident if something serious where to happen.

Until one day she came back and her eyes were gouged out. It was one of the most horrific and painful things I have ever seen. We took her to the veterinary and they said that someone tortured her as well, probably pressing in and destroying her eyes with their fingers or an instrument. I can‚Äôt get that image of them torturing the poor girl out of my head. 

We had the same dilemma: costly veterinary bill or putting her out of her pain. We did the first one- removed (what was left of) her eyes, and sewed them shut. It was a big bill but we thought it was worth it.
Then something inside her head started rotting from the surgery. It was so bad. She was in so much pain. We had to put her down anyways. I still think about her and I wish we had just eased her suffering in the first place.

What I am trying to say is make sure you think long term. I know you love your cat, but remember that there can always be complications from the surgery or it may not go as planned. It‚Äôs tough, but part of being a pet parent is making the responsible but tough decision.

Please do not let your black cats out up to a week before Halloween. People can and will torture/kill black cats solely because of their fur color. Heavily religious people will kill them because they are considered bad omens or another religious person may ""sacrifice"" them. Animal Shelters even usually do not adopt out black cats up to a month before Halloween for this reason.

I would also in general keep your cats inside because friendly (nonferal) cats can be lured away and tortured/killed by messed up people. If you have a not friendly cat then they may be more likely to get hit by a car but a friendly cat that loves people/loves treats can get lured in bad situations.

In situations like these, the best thing is: time.
People who grow up with certain values and mindsets won't change those within a day or two.
I mean if it was that way, LGBTIQ hate wouldn't be a thing anymore.
It is a shock to them in a way, because we all have certain ideas, expectations... However the treatment they've given both you and your partner is not okay at all.
I would address the issue again, private. Telling your family that their behavior was very problematic and hurtful. You are 23 and an adult and even though they have issues accepting your partner, nobody has the right to ridicule another person the way your family did. Not just because of age, but because no human deserves this, EVER!

Ageism is much more of an issue in our society than people wanna acknowledge and while there -at least for now- is no proper solution to your situation, I wanna say to NEVER give up on this love you got going after this issue. What you have with your partner is something far too incredible after all.
I wanna end this rather pointless comment by saying that you should never jump into any sort of confrontation like a bulldozer or a torpedo... Give yourself time to process what happened, comfort your partner and whatever step you take, not only your family seems to need time, you need it too.

Your mom was on the phone having phone sex or something along the lines and your brother might have been in the bathroom (the doors you said opened and closed) he may have been wanking in there, but *unrelated* to your mom‚Äôs phone sex. Meaning he wasn‚Äôt jerking off to her noises.

I wish I could say that your retelling/theory of the events is not plausible, but sadly, it seems a possibility. But take the principle; Innocent until proven guilty. Try your best to come up with theories for what could have happened and do some detective work on your mom and brother, to see if their stories match up and if there is any suspicious behavior.

You could for example tell them that you‚Äôll be leaving for a few hours to hang with a friend, but then secretly sneak back into the house sometime later and then look out for anything that‚Äôs going on in the house without your ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù presence.

1022,fc4nv7_fj95eca,"This is a really strange situation.

I agree with everyone and don't think you should jump to conclusions. But it wouldn't be too crazy to think this might happen considering the situation.

Your dad died and your brother moved back home with mom, filling in the loss of the masculine figure in the home. 

He's the offspring of your father, the man she is mourning. Your brother is also grieving his father, and most likely willingly fulfilled this lost role.

This dynamic probably helped them in the beginning and started innocently. Not sure how or where things got weird, but it obviously had a turning point where things surpassed an emotional support level and morphed into some weird morbid physical relationship.

(Btw... not trying to make excuses or say what they are doing is okay in ANY way, simply sympathizing and theorizing)

**What I would do: I would try to gather more evidence before bringing it up to them.

If you find some time alone in the house, look for remnants of their physical relationship. 

If you get a chance to swipe one of their phones, put it on silent and take it to the bathroom. Look at convos between them. 

If you leave them in a room alone together, don't actually leave. Hang out around the corner out of view and get a feel for how they speak/interact with each other when they think they are alone. 

Obviously... just try not to get caught doing any of this. Otherwise you will have to confront them right then and there.

I dont think i would confront them immediately. I would let last nights incident blow over and act as oblivious to the situation as possible. It will be easier to gather info if they have their guard down.

It seems super sneaky, but I highly doubt your brother or mom would EVER admit that was happening. This is the type of secret you take to the grave. You'll need evidence if you really want the truth.",102,4,1583132872.0,,

I‚Äôve been in many abusive relationships and it took me several years to realize I stayed because I was blind to their betrayal. I needed love really really badly and I was emotionally willing to overlook abuse to feel attachment.

Dude, cry when you feel like crying. For any reason. Holding it in isn't going to do you any favors not now and especially not in the long run. Crying is actually an important component to mental health. I can understand not wanting to cry in front of others. It can be embarrassing. That does mean you shouldn't do it. Especially if you are alone.

When I had to put my cat down last year I felt so dead inside I honestly didn't think I could cry but the instant she passed I couldn't hold in the groan of pain and I literally collapsed on the floor and balled in the exam room. I actually start apologizing in embarrassment to the Vet and her tech. They told me to take all the time I needed and left me to grieve alone. Which I was thankful for. 

I've cried for her at least a dozen times since but each time was shorter and further from the previous. I still get moist eyed thinking about her, as I am now, but the raw gaping pain of her loss has eased because I allowed myself to cry and grieve for her.

If I were you, it would be wise to go get an abortion. You have so much to live for, and having a baby would worsen the situation for you, your boyfriend, and the child. A child deserves to grow up in a stable home.

I'm going to warn you though, that it's going to physically and emotionally cut you inside and out and alter your mental state. Before you plan an abortion, be sure you already have a game plan ""after"" the abortion. I recommend, after a few days or weeks after the abortion (depending on how you will do the abortion will affect the recovery time) you will start going to the gym once a week, and meeting up with a therapist maybe once a month if you have the budget. If you have no budget, then get involved with mental health centers and groups. Or maybe you can pick up on a new hobby or learn a new skill or focus more on academics. You need to DEDICATE in improving yourself physical and mentally and having a ""glow-up"". You can't have an abortion then just try to sweep it under the rug and pretend nothing happen. It's going to come out like a can of worms and it'll really rot you to the core.

You can grieve, actually you SHOULD grieve. Never force yourself to move on too fast. Give yourself all the time in the world. While other people see the early stages of the pregnancy as just a ""clump"" of cells (scientifically they are correct), I am a very sentimental and melancholic person and I see it as a baby still. Try to figure out how you feel about the abortion, and acknowledge it.

It‚Äôs rough out there. I‚Äôm in my late 30s, have super involved parents of my own, a stay at home husband, and am struggling. Having kids is wildly expensive nowadays, and difficult. $20 an hour would net you $32k/year take home in my state after taxes.

We paid $23k/year for our first born six years ago, and by the time our twins came a few years later it was up to $25k/year (which is why my husband now stays home).

The LGBTQ talk might be good too, but I‚Äôd be careful not to set too many expectations and prematurely bias his world-view.  There are some things that are better learned through experience. 

Then, I‚Äôd address your own distress, which I totally understand. You‚Äôre son is growing up faster than you expected, and hearing that bed creak is an undeniable expression of that reality.

I think that‚Äôs something you can work through yourself and with your husband.  Some might try to solve that by shaming sexual expression.  But, remember that he‚Äôs hitting puberty and the transition is totally normal.

Honestly, just having the talk will probably be more than enough to quiet him down.  He‚Äôll realize you heard and feel embarrassed as is.

He‚Äôs growing up, but he‚Äôs still your little munchkin, and he‚Äôll need your guidance, love, and support for years to come.

If you‚Äôre a highly religious family or have moral reservations, I‚Äôd pepper that on last if it‚Äôs especially important to you.

My parent‚Äôs talk was riddled with Catholic shame and it messed with my sexuality until later in life... now I‚Äôm a player and have sex with everything (jk jk)

Personally, I also don‚Äôt think ‚Äúlove‚Äù *needs* to be there.  Sooner or later he‚Äôll realize that people have sex for lots of reasons.  Love, Romantic Love, and Lust are only loosely coupled concepts that don‚Äôt *need* to be coupled in a young teen‚Äôs mind.

That said, as the parent, it‚Äôs your prerogative to distill your own values both explicitly, and implicitly through your actions.

Also, another option is to have that talk together as a couple.  Then neither parent feels too embarrassed, and the boy won‚Äôt feel like he has a secret with one parent.

Second point, you are only 24, still very young and with your whole life in front of you, most likely this as been your only serious relashionship or maybe the second, and in case you don't know what she said to your sister BIG üö©, it shows imaturity and lack of confidence on her part, it's also disrespectfull to you.

Next point, did you talk to her before taking your sister in? Because if not that was VERY BAD on your part, you made a decision that has a responsability long term, did you talk to her about it? Did you live together at that time? And by talking i don't mean saying i decided to take my sister in i mean having a conversation where you explore all the responsabilitys it carrys.

Now you are a good brother, go to your sister and tell her you love her, tell her your pink bracelet is your favorite bracelet in the world, give her a tight hug and a kiss on the head, cudle in front of the tv while watching cartoons and if possible see if her school has a psycologist or a therapist that she can go to.",53,1,1662839154.0,814.0,3272.0

Hopefully once your ex calms down she will move on, but be wary. She has already been shown to be manipulative and she will just try another method of getting what she wants. (Including pretending to be sorry and change her mind)

I wouldn‚Äôt trust her to be alone with your sister, let alone want to be around her after that psychopath adult/child manipulation.

I suggest finding someone for your sister to talk to if she doesn‚Äôt already, and help her work on discovering her own strengths and interests.  Eventually you will have let her spread her wings and for all intents and purposes you are her dad, and always will be. Part of that IMO is letting her be independent, but always being there for her.

Would you really be able to have a longer term relationship with someone who couldn't see your point of view or empathise?

The best way to reassure your sister is to remind her that you are her brother, and Jess's words change nothing. You were there when she needed you before, and you're with her now. Keep it simple and honest.

He likely fell and bonked his head pretty hard. It can happen to anyone.

When I was a child, I slipped on some ice while walking up the driveway to my aunt's house. When my head hit the ice, everything immediately turned into a shade of yellow and sound became more reverb'd and distant. I felt woozy and saw trails when looking around.

My parents were panicking and trying to keep me awake. I had certainly suffered a concussion and my subsequent behaviors were altered for a few weeks afterwards. My sleeping was longer, my taste in foods had changed, and I was more temperamental, more combative. My memory was also affected.

Let me tell you something. My partner and I are best friends. We've been together for 3 years, lived together for 2. We laugh like little kids over stupid shit. We literally have our own language of nonsensical words. He has a higher libido than me, and we've had discussions about how we can ensure that both of us are satisfied. We talk in detail about anything and everything that comes to mind. I'm closer to this man, love him more, and know him better, than anyone previously in my entire life. We fit together like puzzle pieces. 

And we're **still not 100% sure about marriage.** These things can change. People grow. You learn things about people and you learn that you can't put up with those things for life. Maybe in a couple of years our individual destinies will take us away from each other or allow one or both of us to take an opportunity in our lives that doesn't have room for the other person. That's totally fair and okay. But until we know with at least *more* certainty that that won't be the case, it would be highly irresponsible to marry.

Frankly, just based on your profile, I don't think you should marry this guy. At least, not yet... It seems that you don't even know him well enough to decide yet if you could spend your life with him. Shaving should be something you are more than open and comfortable discussing, long before marriage.  You should feel secure that he's going somewhere without you, even Vegas.

You're 16. You are NOT ready to be a parent by any means.

You didn't use protection and relied on the pullout method, which is stupid. It's 2021, you should know better. You DO know better. BOTH of you know better.

You think you'll regret an abortion? How much will you regret the rest of your life being a teen mom? Do you have any idea how much you are going to STRUGGLE? Do you have any idea how much this is going to not only impact your future, but of the future of the boy you slept with? You think he wants to be a dad at 16? You think he'll actively participate and you'll be a happy family?

It takes over $230,000 to raise a kid. How do you plan on doing it? How do you plan on finishing school? Going to collage? Supporting yourself? Are you expecting your mom and dad to pitch in and do all the hard work for the first few years? Don't. They did their raising, if they wanted to start over they would have another kid.

Right now you're not thinking, you're panicking. You know EXACTLY what the right thing to do is, and you don't want to.

What would you prefer kid; maybe regretting an abortion now, or regretting NOT getting one when the rest of your life is struggle and stress? No more freedom to do what you want, no more parties, no more just chillin' with your friends for the weekend. None of it. You will have a child and every move you do after that will have to focus on THEM and not yourself ever again.

The fact that you want to run away from all this instead of dealing with it shows that you're not meant to have a child yet.

First thing to note is (which now you probably realize) never ever use the pull out method as contraception. Its not super effective and you should always be safe.

Next- You have three possible options.

1. Abortion. I know your weary of it, however (if you don't want to keep the baby,) its in my opinion the best method. You wont have any connection with the baby and the baby wont have to face the ""I'm adopted whos my real mother"" thing later in life. However it can make you feel guilty. Either way, definitely call PP.
2. Adoption. You wont have to keep the baby or terminate the fetus, so its good for moral concerns. However, the kid wont know its real mom which may cause it to have mental problems. This would require you to go through painful birth and you will get a pregnancy body, which may leave you insecure. Also, you may have to miss a lot of school, and since your a sophomore/junior as well as a minor, childbirth may not be good for your body.
3. Keep it. This would be guilt free, but it would cause financial issues. even if your parents help, You will still need to provide much of the finance by yourself. And once you graduate, you will be left on your own with a baby in your arms. Once again, pregnancy issues. Postpartum depression, C-sections, possible permanent issues. Your a teen and pregnancy is more dangerous.

I would do this- consult the baby daddy. Tell him what's happening and see if he's willing to raise it with you. You might have your parents, but when you graduate your going to need support other than your own finances to raise the child. If he's not willing to, I see it as abortion and adoption are your best bets. Whether you get an abortion or not, call planned parenthood, look closer at your options, and get tested for (ST) diseases as well. (just to make sure).  I request an abortion because no matter if you can care for it or not, pregnancy is super. duper. dangerous. especially at your age. Moral soundness is not and shouldn't be your concern. It should be your life and heath. The abortion is safer, cheaper, and more effective than anything else you could do in this situation. but its your choice, and I wish you luck no matter what you do.",18,2,1618871615.0,2122.0,40.0

1514,mu7x2h_gv7ymaa,"Update: 4/20:  I wanted to give everyone an update about this morning.  So I am pregnant.  It finally hit me what all that meant and I was happy, sad, confused, overwhelmed, and upset all at once.   I went to see a gynecologist for the first time and that was terrifying, she was so nice but it hurt and I felt so violated.  My mom said, ""you think that is bad, just wait until there are 10 people working there while you are giving birth"", that made me throw-up.  I threw-up for 20 minutes.  It hurts so much.    

So I am pregnant.  There is a big problem with it that I don't really fully understand.  Everything has been a blur and I can't really get everything that everyone is saying.  I have an extra uterine pregnancy, they said the baby isn't where it is supposed to be, like in the extra uterus (makes no sense) or in the felopean tubes.   The baby won't grow there and it will cause bleeding and a lot of medical issues so I have to get an abortion.    I don't have a choice because it might kill me or cause serious issues.  I threw up when I heard this too.  I've been throwing up all morning and so dizzy.    

My mom and dad met with my friend's dad last night when I was asleep.  I thought we were going to do this tonight but they thought it would be best.  So Mike, my friend, was at my house at 7:00 this morning with my favorite donut and a cup of tea.  He knows me.   I cried as soon as I saw him and told him I was so sorry, and he hugged me and said ""no, this was my fault, I should have insisted on the condom or told you no until we were more prepared"".  I said ""you didn't even want it"" and he responded ""I wanted it more than anything, but didn't want to let you down or do something wrong, you are so special to me"".   I fucking died right there.   I started crying at like 7:00 and haven't really stopped yet.   It is probably the hormones but the puking and crying haven't stopped since 7:00 and I feel so great about what he said to me, like those are the most magical words that I've ever heard.  ""you are so special to me"", the way he said that, the feeling when he held me.  OMG, what the fuck is wrong with me! 

I am pregnant and my pregnancy will end around 2:00 today.   I am at the surgical center waiting for my mom's gynecologist and another doctor to arrive.   I feel so alone and so sick.  I'm a mess.  I'm thinking about Mike right now and I wish things were different.   I wish I saw him before the way I am thinking of him now.   I hope that this doesn't ruin our friendship. I hope this doesn't ruin me too.  I feel sort of good that the decision was made for me, like this wasn't meant to be.  It was an at fault accident that I caused.  Oh god, I am so sick to my stomach and my body hurts.  My heart hurts.  My brain hurts.   

A doctor or nurse just came in to draw a line on my stomach and she touched my vjay to check for something and then left.  I don't know what she was doing but my mom had to go to the other side of the curtain for it.   The nurse told her that I would be taken down the hall in a few minutes, so I need to wrap this up.   I've never been so nervous, or felt so small and helpless as I do right now.   Everything is outside my control right now.   I'm getting anithesia, or however it is spelled, in a few minutes so I'll say bye and check back if I'm still alive after the procedure.

1516,mu7x2h_gv781uf,"Reasons to have an abortion :

1. The average child costs $250,000 to raise from 0 to 18 years old. This does NOT include college

2. You are not in a stable relationship. And the kid will likely grow up fatherless.

3. Adoption and foster care system is pure dog shit.

4. Climate change is about to fuck humanity very very very hard. Famine and war will be very common in 10 to 20 years. I'll happily provide sources upon request. 

5. An fetus is just a clump of cells. It is not morally wrong  to remove a clump of cells with no consciousness from your body. 


Reasons to not have an abortion :

1. Because you'll feel depressed for a few months and the move on with your life, like 99% of the other people that get abortions do. 

Keeping the fetus makes NO logical sense. 

If you think you are doing your your fetus and yourself a favor by keeping the baby you are very mistaken. Statistically speaking this is NOT going to end well at all. Please reconsider having an abortion. 

You will be doing the fetus a massive favor by not following through with your pregnancy and noy giving it a stressful and depressing life.

I hate to be so negative but this is the cold hard truth. If you thinking abortion is hard think about how hard it's going to be to raise a kid for 18 years, without a father and while being dirt poor.",15,0,1618926073.0,2122.0,
1517,mu7x2h_gv4ywl7,"Glad to hear your moms supportive about this. But I agree with the redditors who say abortion is the best option. Of course keeping the baby is something most people would want, but the problem is you're only 16. This means you will be unable to live the rest of your teen years out and must become a full time mom. This also means you'll need to get a job and with every dime you make, it needs to be put towards the baby, even then I dont think that'll be enough as is. Babies are expensive, *VERY expensive*. I don't have my own (I'm 20F) but my mom ended up having a surprise baby 4 ish years ago. So I got to see first hand how it is raising a child.  


First is the pregnancy, the preparation for the child, the multiple appointments, the large vitamins you'll probably have to take, many other things that also come with pregnancy. Once your baby is born you need to expect to lose almost ALL your sleep. Depending on the child the baby can stay up all night either A, crying because of many needs, or B, crying because it can just cry. You'll be waking up at 1am, 2am, 3am, 4am, etc (this depends if your child doesnt manage to sleep well through nights, my mom got lucky and my sister only woke up at around 7am after going to bed I thinkkk around 9pm? I cant entirely remember since it was a few years ago but a routine helps).

Now with time going by, you'll be spending most of your money on the child, you'll lose the ability to hang out with friends, go out, you'll always be tired and will usually only stay home or go to work (because children are VERY expensive, google baby supplies youll see what I mean).

Adoption isnt a bad choice though. However sometimes the system can be really bad, depends where you are I suppose.

However, abortion (dont let people tell you its murder it really isnt), will definitely save you the headache of raising a child (not that it doesnt have its pros but the cons are pretty big at least for your current age). But choose whatever you want to do since this is about your body so the decision is up to you, nobody else.

Just wanna warn you though. A lot of my friends are having kids/have kids now so they cant live life like I am freely and buy whatever I want since all your money would have to go towards the child. But for some people that isnt so bad. It just isnt for everyone.

Make sure the father of the child knows though, although I dont have much experience with this yeah imo its probably a good idea for him to be aware of the situation too.

I suppose a **TLDR**: If you choose to keep the child you will be skipping the rest of your teenage years and will have to become (most likely at first for awhile) a stay at home mom, being unable to afford things you like, having no energy, no time to yourself, etc.

ALSO. Pulling out makes no difference then not pulling out at all, its called pre cum, its uncontrollably and it just happens for guys. The best way to have sex is with condoms and if possible, get on birth control (not now since you're pregnant but something for the future)",10,1,1618872246.0,2122.0,2279.0
1518,mu7x2h_gv4i9wh,"Ok, here‚Äôs the deal. You got 3 options. 
1) Abortion. Abortion is not a bad thing at all and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise. If that‚Äôs what you choose to do that‚Äôs what you do. But you need to make a decision quickly as I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a cut off time to decide that kind of thing (not 100% sure tho. I think it‚Äôs based on where you live) 
2) Adoption. Newborns are usually adopted fairly quickly (I believe) and you can do a closed adoption so you never have to know anything about the baby. 

3) Keep it. But just be aware of the financial responsibilities, and don‚Äôt plan on your parents helping you. (Not saying they wouldn‚Äôt, I obviously don‚Äôt know your parents at all) 

Obviously you need to sit your parents down, because they‚Äôre going to find out sooner than later. Just tell them the truth and go from there. Based on your comments it doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre in danger of being kicked out by them. But maybe have a backup plan incase things go south.

I say that because you are so young! You're not even an adult yourself yet. You are still a child, who has so much life ahead of her.

I know a lot of people will probably hate me for saying this, and I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion but the way I see it is, if you keep this child, your childhood is over. That's it. It'll just poof and gone.

There will be no more time for you to have fun, or do stupid things and make mistakes. But honestly, that's what being 16 is about. You're not supposed to have the responsibility (and burden) of parenthood at that age.

This is the age where you should be being social, partying, enjoying life to the fullest. Because once you become an adult and have actual responsibilities you lose the option to just do whatever you want.

So, if I were you, I would certainly just have an abortion and enjoy the rest of your teenage years to the fullest. When you're a little older, maybe mid-late 20's or 30's and want to have a kid go ahead.

So i became a single mom before our son was even born. 

Wether he stayed or not, i was gonna keep the baby either way. But if you decide to keep the baby because he wants you to, there's no telling if he will actually stick around.

This quote from Ira Glass resonated with me the first time I read it years ago and still makes sense now:

Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had told this to me.
All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But it's like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good. It‚Äôs not that great. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it‚Äôs not that good.
But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They quit.
Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that.
And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you're going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions.
I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. It takes awhile. It‚Äôs gonna take you a while. It‚Äôs normal to take a while. You just have to fight your way through that.",18,0,1605750886.0,1632.0,10960.0

It would appear it isn‚Äôt quite over.

So I walked down the stairs to make sure the front door is locked muttering ‚Äúfucking twats‚Äù about the people leaving it open and there she was standing in the entrance to the building in the pitch-black swaying back and forth and completely out of it not responding.

I quickly went back to my flat, called 999 and they were going to dispatch the police and an ambulance but asked if she was still there, I checked and she was gone. I guess me going back up the stairs snapped her out of it because she must have been there for 90 minutes.... fucking weird.

Sent the letting agent of the other flat an email asking them to remind them to lock the fucking door, I have tried asking them and they never answer their door (as said in another comment, my understanding is that the tenant is ill so isn't there and has family coming in and out checking on the place... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)",14,1,1614036290.0,2185.0,17705.0

But sure, let's treat her like she is completely rational

I left a note for the neighbour downstairs about the door, they came up and apologised this evening, said they didn't realise there was anyone else still living in the building they thought everyone was moving out and he was the only person left (and he is gone soon) so he had just been lazy and not been locking the door but will do so now.

Also got a reply from my MP (or her office) they have written to the police highlighting the concern for her mental health and also to the local council over the fact that she does not seem to be receiving help.",15,3,1614113642.0,2185.0,17705.0

They said, ""maybe you can phone the police and say she attacked your door again, then when they come and arrest her we can remove all her stuff and change her locks"". Fucking incredible, obviously I refused. They are waiting around hoping she goes out.

Fucking hell, like even if they do that, she is just going to be waiting outside to get back in, what the hell is she going to do when she finds out she can't get back in the building? Jesus fucking christ

1614,li84c6_gnzduqg,"UPDATE:

So of course the arresting officer who was going to call me ""just after starting work at 1400 hours"" never did, for the second time in 3 days. Similarly after calling 101 in a panic at 7 am as she was pounding on the door like in the original video in this thread no one has turned up, for the second day running. It is as if they think if they just ignore it then it will go away, I mean I suppose it has, at least for me, but through no action of theirs. As far as they know she is still here and still a threat to me; all that is going to happen is she is going to presumably start the whole thing over again elsewhere, I dread to think what might happen... think I will set up a Google news alert for her name.

Thanks, everyone for your advice and support over the last week, it has been really helpful and comforting. Just getting this all written down has helped me realise just how utterly insane this whole situation has been, I think if you don't write these things down there is a risk that you start to think you are over exaggerating. Similarly when friends and family react there is a possibility that they may be overly concerned or siding with you since they know you but when a bunch of strangers are just as concerned about the whole thing it shows just how scary it was.

This weekend I shall definitely be sorting out that complaint to the IOPC, and my friend's wife advised me to still write to the local councillors responsible so that they are at least aware of what has been going on and the police's seeming indifference to it; leaving it a couple of days until I am a bit more level headed, calmer and can frame it better rather than just being an angry, frustrated & scared rant.

Guess this is the final update. If I actually hear back from the police I may post again but at this stage, it doesn't feel at all likely given their response so far.

If the CPS decide it is not in the public interest to go to court, or once it has been through court I will do a new thread just to share the videos of Monday and the times since so that people can see how scary it is. I was rewatching the break-in and the following hour last night and either she is the world's best actor or the police are utterly insane, it is like 2 completely different people.

He said she was charged with criminal damage and admitted it, he has checked the file and was surprised there was no condition on her bail to stay off of this floor... he said it was even filled in badly so he has already complained to the line manager of the PC in charge of the case.

I said about her knocking and telling me to hand over my keys because I am being evicted and he replied ""yeah she is clearly crazy...."" I bit my tongue and stopped myself from saying ""So why is no one referring her?"" (Presumably because she admitted it).

After he tells you about this kink and you tell him that you are not into it he's now manipulating you. He's testing the waters to see how far he can go. He's doing it now to normalize this behavior for when your child does arrive. 


He completely disregards how you feel about children and how precious they are to you. You realize that is part of who you are and I feel he's clearly disrespecting you.

The amount of porn and how frequently he gets off to it. He's using your body to masturbate. Also, he's into little kids. Vulnerable babies. He's falling asleep to it and I really think this all came out because he wants a child to abuse. He's been waiting.

Still this does not have to mean that your marriage is doomed, if both of you are willing to really work on it and communicate with absolute honesty.

As a personal anecdote, my wife actually told me, after we had been married for some years, that she had a ""one that got away"".
Keeping it to herself had been consuming her from the inside. After she admitted it, I of course was crushed. Over time though, through discussing it more and more, it became less of an issue. She realized that she had held on to an ideal and a ""what if?"" and not an actual person. This had been keeping her from fully committing to me.

So she did something pretty awful, and also kind of unfixable, because if she meant it you should divorce and if she didn‚Äôt mean it you should find a way to let it go (and she should stop drinking) but there‚Äôs no way to know which of those two drastically different solutions to employ because only she knows how she really feels and you can‚Äôt trust what she says.

1711,181yqfe_kag509t,"I have some information which might prove to be relevant to you. At least I made the connection.

I don't know psychology, and am just an armchair psychologist. This needs therapy imo.

But.. therapy doesn't work on people who aren't willing, or won't tell the truth.


There is a fundamental truth of people you have to understand, people are insecure. They are anxious, traumatised, have low self esteem and are running away from themselves.

In general people have emotional issues, and this dictates their lives to huge extents.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

There are people who seek love in order to fill a void in themselves, instead of seeking love for love's sake.

Are they incapable of loving? No they aren't, not by any stretch.

Do they ask more than the relationship can give? Perhaps.

A relationship can't sustain YOU and your self worth. If you try to get that support, the relationship will colapse.

Now comes the part i think might be relevant- 

Full disclosure, I read this in a newspaper article. This is extremely simple, but might be pertinent.

The headline read- Is your relationship out of love or loneliness?

People who love out of love can tolerate separation even if they miss their partner

People who love out of loneliness can't tolerate separation and get anxious when separated

People who love out of love will be sad to breakup and very hurt, but will prioritise your happiness along with theirs.

People who love out of loneliness will freak out when a breakup is on the horizon. They'll get irate or start shouting, or get very stressed


People who love out of love, have a calm and kind love

People who love out of loneliness will have a clingy and needy love



That's not to say that people who love out of loneliness may be incapable of love. It may be the case that they settle for partners who they might not want because they fear being alone.

These links might be useful.

Now, I've heard that when people get blackout drunk, people can say the most random or batshit insane things. Alcoholics have reported to saying things a complete180 of their actual beliefs.

So there's no guarantee what your wife said are 100% her inner thoughts. They might also not be.

What you said, there are very minor 'clues' if you consider them such.

She's not willing to take responsibility (the drop off in housework and effort after some time passed - you will not be able to pull off an unsustainable habit, by definition)

She doesn't have a job and likely has self esteem issues, as she stated she felt insecure due to not having a job, although that could've been a lie to appease you.

And it's sort of telling that she went to a 0 - 100 after an incident. Not that it happened, any spouse will be in ""makeup with hubby"" mode after that happened, but there's something to note about the quality of it.


Here you are who's been hurt, and your self esteem has been shattered.

How does she make it up to you?

By being extra nice
By doing all the chores so you feel grateful
By TAKING all the responsibility
By dolling up to appease you visually


I ask you, how's any of that relevant in a broken self esteem?

It's not. It helps the hurt sure, a small bit, but it's fundamentally (imo) a giant appeasement effort.

And appeasement is a misdirection tactic. It avoids paying the real price (earning trust) while gently coaxing you into a better mood.

Don't accept it.

There are many many examples of spouses who do nothing but video game all day, scroll online and are also in a dysfunctional relationship.

The relevant interpretation being the bad lifestyle and the bad relationship is a side-effect of dysfunction inside of them.

Do you think that's the case?

How well do you know your wife?

Is it possible that your wife has deep emotional issues which she has hid from you and just can't or doesn't want to tell you?

Some people don't want to solve their problems. They just want to put on a band aid and forget.

What's the probability of a person behaving like your wife did, if the person was deeply insecure, and was in a relationship out of loneliness and was repressing feelings of inadequacy which came from settling with someone who wasn't the fantastic ideal in all conceivable dimensions?

What's the probability of that behaviour, given the emotional issues were assumed to be true?

Is it possible that you were chosen for your wealth and status? Because there are plenty of people who go for that.


Start watching her like a hawk. Stop communicating with her. Collect data over a long enough interval of time. And do not allow her the opportunity to modify her behaviour.

Be precise in your observations. You'll have your answer in her behaviour to an extent.


It may turn out that she's not a good partner or it might not turn out that way.

In the former case, if you want to continue the relationship, get her to a personal therapist asap. Also go to couples therapist.

Some couples counsellors aren't therapist, I wouldn't recommend those.
You have money so seek out an actual therapist who does couples therapy.


And lastly. None of this is a reflection on you. It's a reflection on her. I suspect all this is because of some bad beliefs she has about herself and the world.

Don't take it so hard although that's foolish sounding at this time.

Get a therapist yourself. A lot of things will become clear.

Good luck and you'll survive and thrive. Dont give up.",18,1,1700753399.0,916.0,33448.0

While I'm grateful to my mom and everything that she did for me, I secretly wish I was never born so that she had a chance to do all the things she wanted to.

Children should be conceived for the joy of raising them, not simply because it's the next step in life.  While some people may think that you're ""murdering"" a life, it's ultimately your body and your choice.  What your bf's parents don't realize is that if you don't have the resources to support the child, it will end up making both you and your child miserable.  If they can't take the time to understand your disease and conditions just because they want a grandchild, I suggest they start looking elsewhere.

It's your life, it's just as valuable as anyone else's, It's also your decision.  You seem very adamant on getting an abortion, so my advice?  Take that decision in stride and keep moving forward, don't let anyone drag you down for said decision.  Don't worry about others opinions because they're not going to do nothing for you.

1874,xtr27j_iqt01v1,"I lost my virginity at 11 and was having sex freauently at 13. My mom wasn't around much, she was an alcoholic, worked nights, and I was often left alone without much supervision and full access to the internet. I was heavily influenced by my peers and media and constantly seeking attention.

I basically told my mom I wasn't going to stop and there was nothing she could do about it. My mom had gotten pregnant at 13, and I thought I was destined to walk in her footsteps. 

She bought condoms, put me on birth control (depo prevera, avoid that at all costs), and tried to be present and meet my boyfriends. 

So many older boys/men were into me. I thought it was the best feeling ever. At 11 and 12, I lied about my age and had sex with 15-17 year old boys. At 13, I stopped lying about my age and eventually started dating an 18 year old, who later went to jail for sex abuse. By 14, I was partying and doing drugs with grown ass men, upwards of 30 years old who knew how old I was. The amount of attention I received during those years... Crazy to look back on. 

I'm now in my 30s and have had a lot of time to reflect on my upbringing. I wish my mom was more proactive about people's intentions and spent more time with me, getting to know me, helping me grow my confidence and teaching me how to stick up for myself. I wish I knew how to value my body. Though she never knew any of those things herself, so how was she supposed to teach me?

I spent a summer living with my grandparents. Although it wasn't the most healthy relationship at times, we spent a lot of time together. I made healthy friendships and learned that I didn't have to have sex or do drugs to have fun or be cool. They drove me to school everyday, signed me up for snowboarding lessons, monitored my computer use, didn't allow me to be out past a certain hour, we ate breakfast and dinner together every night. They confronted my angsty behavior and signed me up for therapy.

When I came back, my mom enrolled me in hybrid homeschool. I lost contact with all of my bad influence friends. I then started working at 14. My mom was also on house arrest during this time and we spent more time together. By the time I was 15, I just... Stopped doing whatever I was doing. Partly because I didn't have any external influence, and I was also monitored more heaviliy. 

I don't have the correct answer for you, but I hope that sharing my story can offer some insight as far as what's going on through her head.",14,1,1664746505.0,838.0,430.0

Teens are very resourceful.  I was a foster parent for 14 years for teen girls as young as 12.  If they want to have sex, they will find a way.  On the bus, in the school bathroom, under the school stairs, at the football game, at their friend's house, they will sneak out the window or just wait until you are asleep to sneak out the door.  These were all used by some of the girls we took care of.

My vote is that it is better to be on birth control.  You also need to have long talks about the dangers of STDs and the emotional cost of early sex.  Look for adults or older kids in her life that may be grooming her.  KEEP THE COMMUNICATION LINES OPEN.",62,0,1664734997.0,838.0,21508.0

Given that your daughter will figure out how to have sex even if you disapprove, it is in your and her best interest to be proactive about birth control. This does not mean you approve of her having sex. You can accompany the birth control with ongoing conversations about making good relationship choices, about the pro/con of starting sexual relationships, the pro/con of starting to he sexual, empowering her to make good decisions and resist being coerced or pressured into doing things she doesn‚Äôt want to do, how to keep herself physically and emotionally safe, etc.

I'm guessing this is about him feeling insecure and because in his mind if you are out of his reach you could cheat on him, so he feels jealous but is unable to express it. 

He then waits until before the trip (allegedly to ""test your commitment) when even he probably realizes to some extent he has no real reason to have anything against it besides feeling insecure.

This is blackmail. He uses marriage as bait to see how far you will allow him to go, how much manipulation and pressure you will tolerate. I cannot imagine a person who does this did not show other red flags but you live together and have a kid so it doesn't matter. What matters is that you realized this is messed up and you are 100% right.

This isn't about a vacation at all. This isn't about loyalty or sacrifice. This 100% is about control, manipulation and his inability to face discomfort (face his own fears). Insecure people like him treat you like shit and deep down they know it so they expect you to leave, that is why he expects ""proof"". This will not be the end. If you give in he will continue in similar or other ways to manipulate you out of his own lack of maturity.

The best solution is to call up the companies involved and let them know your situation. Most of the time, as long as you don't do so regularly and let them know ahead of time, companies are willing to put a hold on an account instead of going to collections due to nonpayment (if the explanation is reasonable and they can be reasonably assured they will get payment soon, it is in their best interests to do so -- collections costs *them* money too).

If you still have problems after, you may look into short-term loans. Just be **sure** to pay them back in full once your previous paycheck comes in, and be absolutely minimal in your use of them.

Also, the shutdown thing is becoming more and more common. It may behoove you to plan for it next year.

I agree that you should contact every one of your creditors and explain your situation.  Ask to defer all of your payments for X days (without additional fees or interest) after you receive and can access your back pay.  The creditors should be prepared for this.  As the shutdown grows more unpopular (which seems to be the case), companies should be concerned about their public image, and should treat unpaid feds reasonably under the circumstances.  If you are a good customer, you are probably still a good credit risk, and they will want to keep you.    

Also, some banks and credit unions are offering free/low interest loans to feds who are unpaid due to the shutdown.  Call your bank, but consider others.  

Also, I really think back pay will be paid for to those who worked during the shutdown. Even if they cut back pay, I think they would still pay the people who actually worked during the shutdown.  

Finallly (and this is the preachy part), once everything gets back to normal, this is a great incentive to start building a 6-month emergency fund.

Our parents got home around 11:45am and i had told them i needed to talk to them as soon as possible. I showed them the texts and he had even texted her again asking her why she hadnt been responding to her earlier in the morning. i didnt respond to it. i took her phone for the night and when our parents got home, as soon as i could i told them about it and my dad i can tell you this, would have gone to jail if my mom wasnt there to stop him from leaving the room. he was pissed off more then id ever seen him as i was scrolling threw the texts with them. my mom was more just wondering what we would do at that point.

My dad contacted Harry's dad and told him all of it and rightfully, he was angry too. I mean his dad and my dad had been good friends for a while because of me and Harrys friendship. theyve both agreed to not let it effect their friendship but would still be taking it serious. Harrys parents have spoken to him about it and i have yet to ask if they found anything else on his phone, since they did mention they were going to go through his phone and check out what he had been doing. Scrolling to the start of the texts, he had texted her first on January 21st. so he had been talking to her for a WHILE before i found out. talking to her about very sexual things, things i bet he wouldnt have asked his girlfriend, not saying he had one im just saying if he had one. hes never had one hes about 125 pounds and 5'7. i tower over him. i dont think ive ever seen him have more then a 15 second conversation with a girl. other then my 10 year old little sister.

- fruits: plums, cherries, berries, apples, pears, peaches, kiwi, figs‚Ä¶ anything that doesn‚Äôt have a peel. you can either hide the pits/core or throw them out the window if they barge into your room. hopefully they‚Äôll stay hidden. 

- veggies: tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, radishes‚Ä¶ these have virtually no waste, can be brought into the bathroom for a rince before eating them without them noticing. 

- pantry items: i saw a lot of people telling you to buy a kettle but you mentioned no appliances, i‚Äôm assuming this includes kettles. now, here‚Äôs a tip: you don‚Äôt actually need boiling water for ramen noodles or dried up food. hottest water from your sink will do the trick. you can find instant anything: soup, ramen, pasta, dehydrated dishes in general. 

- definitely look at baby food. not a joke. they are nutritious, you‚Äôd have to double check the labels. you can also grab those drinks and desserts made for severely underweight people. it‚Äôll bring you nutrients and calories. if you can grab some on the daily, they can also be discreet. a bottle in a side pocket of the backpack or inside pocket of your jacket for the evening, another hidden somewhere else for the following morning. 

- high in protein ready made drinks, biscuits etc. anything someone going to the gym but who hates cooking would buy. 

- jerky, cured meat in general. packets are small and can be zipped up to avoid pests. 

- oats, in a secure container. you can eat it plain if need be. you can add plenty of stuff to it to make it sweet or savoury. you can make overnight oats by placing them in a closed cup with water, mix it with yoghurt, fruit and so on‚Ä¶ filled with fibres, calories and some protein too. they are extremely filling and cheap.

3. Fruit like people have said. Apples will last the longest. 

Lunch 

1. Supermarkets sometimes do instant salads, which you can pile up. Tinned salmon or tuna and dressings/sauces. Try to aim for pre packed picnic food. You might even find some pre made potato salad you can add to the salads too. Actually quite yum.

2119,1e7usn0_le3acwt,"OP, I want to first say I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre in this position at all but second I want to say be vigilant as fuck. When I had just turned 14 my littlest sister who was only 9 years old at the time found hidden cameras in mine and my sisters bathroom that only us 4 girls used in the house. The cameras were put there by my mom‚Äôs fianc√©. He set up a website the police knew existed but couldn‚Äôt find, with a partner the police never caught with footage of us girls using the bathroom and showering, we all were only 9-14 years old. 

The thing is when I was 12 I told my mom that this creep was looking at my sisters, our female friends we‚Äôd have over and I inappropriately. That he had walked in on the two youngest changing and would not leave while staring at their naked bodies and was generally being creepy and inappropriate with us all. She didn‚Äôt listen, he convinced her and my counselor I had reported it to at the time that it was all in my head and she made me apologize to him. 

I hid from them for three days afterward sobbing and having panic attacks refusing to apologize to him but I ended up having to do it while he had a shit eating grin on his face the whole time. It wasn‚Äôt two years later these cameras were found and our lives were utterly destroyed. That altered the course of all our lives so negatively that my little sisters and I never recovered fully from it. It messed me up so bad for so long knowing I tried desperately to protect my little sisters and I failed. It hurt me so much more to know this was happening to them than me and I struggled with that for so long. 

Given my history I would believe your husband had inappropriate intentions and I would be leaving with my kids regardless of what he says about it. You can ask him about it all you want but it‚Äôs not likely he would admit to being a pedophile. Please talk to your daughter, ask her in a gentle non judgmental way about your husband and if anything has happened that has made her uncomfortable or worse and listen to her please. Get her into counseling so a professional can talk to her and get to the bottom of this. If you can get yourself into counseling to get help coping with this and handling it. 

If you plan on staying as I said be so fucking vigilant, again I would not stay. I don‚Äôt see any good reason for him to have this stuff on his phone at all. Unfortunately sometimes we think we know a person because they are really freaking good at hiding who they truly are and then we find out we didn‚Äôt know them at all until after they do something horrible. 

If you stay do not ever, ever leave her alone with him again, watch him like a freaking hawk, sweep your house regularly for cameras that shouldn‚Äôt be there, check in with her regularly, check his phone and electronics regularly. Again I absolutely would not stay. 

The damage that was done by my mom‚Äôs fianc√© was so severe and far reaching, my sisters and I will carry this with us until we die. It is so traumatizing, your sense of safety and autonomy is absolutely shattered. You can‚Äôt trust people anymore, the violation you feel is so deep it‚Äôs physically sickening. Please don‚Äôt be like my mom, protect your kids, do not fail them. The damage is immense and far reaching and it will negatively alter your daughters life for the rest of her life. 

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this, I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre having to question your husband at all. I‚Äôm so sorry about any negative consequences you and your daughter may have to deal with as a result of this. I‚Äôm so sorry that there are evil people in the world. I wish you and your children the very best and again I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you all.",149,1,1721488201.0,750.0,9009.0

I'm not going to go into detail but it was definitely ongoing abuse that was preceded and accompanied by significant physical abuse used to manipulate me into not saying out of fear. No one did anything about it. 

This is what I would do:
*Have an art session with crayons or markers and ask her to draw a picture of her family. Keep it as simple as that. Do NOT overcomplicate this. Sometimes this exercise can speak volumes and other times it can indicate another simple answer for recent behaviors. Do this but ALSO....

*Schedule immediately with a child psychologist. They are trained to find answers to these questions without damaging or further traumatizing your child.

*Do not, for any reason, leave your child alone with him.

*Be extremely careful if you decide to use cameras. For both you and your child's safety should he discover them. 

*Get yourself into therapy as soon as possible. This is a heavy thing to carry on your shoulders and you shouldn't do it alone. You deserve support.

I noticed after I split up with my daughters mom that talking about things related but not asking had my daughter openly telling me things that gave me concerns and when we would draw pictures, her drawing would have her explaining it and still saying things that had me concerned. 

But while that can take time, look up hidden cams and place them in your home. Ones that are discrete or can be hidden in pictures, stuff animals, etc and place them in common rooms in the house (living room, your bedroom, her bedroom) and see if you can find something.

(Unless this wedding was pretty recent - I‚Äôm assuming it didn‚Äôt happen in 2020 because Covid - so I‚Äôm guessing the wedding was 2019 or earlier?) 

If she is willing to call this man her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and break plans with her SO to hang out with him, IMO - that means that they‚Äôve been keeping contact this entire time. 

Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôd be weird to break plans... just so you could meet up with some random dude you knew for maybe a couple days at a wedding - AND you haven‚Äôt talked to them in years?

That‚Äôs strange, right? Logically, it only makes sense if they‚Äôve been talking this whole time. So my next question - and let‚Äôs think logically here: why would someone spend years keeping in contact with a person they met once... and never mention them to their SO? 

And if they didn‚Äôt stay in contact... well that just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me either. If some random guy ditched a trip with his wife and friends to come see me (after years of not speaking and only meeting once) ... It would definitely give me the impression that he REALLY wants me, and/or is a stalker.

This is where my imagination leads me: She met an attractive guy at a wedding and sparks were flying. They had a great time and exchanged numbers. She comes back and acts the same because she didn‚Äôt technically do anything wrong. She didn‚Äôt physically cheat. So... you don‚Äôt notice anything, everything seems normal. But maybe she secretly has spent years fantasizing about being with this guy, and wonders what her life could be like with him. They stay in contact and exchange flirtatious messages back and forth every now and then. A little ego boost for her, but she doesn‚Äôt see the harm since he lives far away. She doesn‚Äôt mention him to you, because why would she? She probably does deep down she does feel a little guilty about it.

But then, an opportunity arises where they are able to meet up. It‚Äôs the perfect opportunity... you‚Äôll be with friends and out of town, distracted. His friends just moved back so it‚Äôs the perfect opportunity and excuse for him to visit her, without sounding off any alarms.

If he came out to where I live to hang out with me, I'd definitely bring my gf with me. I'd like them to meet. He's a great guy, and I think him and my gf would get along really well.

He may even be very sweet and loving sometimes, or has been in the past. It‚Äôs not your fault you are staying- his brain is literally programmed to make his victims just happy enough to stay and become dependent on him. This is his area of expertise.

I am very concerned about your health and well-being, and also very concerned for your life. If he has joked about this and is setting up a scenario where people could believe you killed yourself- that is scary. People don‚Äôt joke about killing each other like that. It‚Äôs not a funny like I stole the last apple and someone says, ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm gonna kill you!‚Äù as they throw some crumpled up paper at you or something. That was a detailed account of how he‚Äôd do it and that he thinks it‚Äôs totally possible for him to get away with it. It felt like a warning to me. 

Now, I can see that feeling hard to believe because really, would he kill you? (I think yes, but no one can be 100% sure). What we do know though is that yes, he is emotionally abusing you. Threats of violence alone are emotionally abusive, let alone saying he could kill you, and also using you to get out of work in such a manner as to kill your reputation with them. He doesn‚Äôt want anyone to take you seriously and I would be surprised if he hasn‚Äôt managed to isolate you from anyone that would warn you about his behavior. Again- this is not your fault. Your husband has spent his whole life honing his skills to catch and isolate victims until he‚Äôs the only thing they have and then he can torture them because they can‚Äôt leave.

You may feel I am being too harsh on him. I‚Äôm fairly sure he must‚Äôve had an absolute nightmare of a childhood for him to end up this way. I know many would not agree with this when he threatened your life, but I do feel a little empathy for him in that regard. However, feeling that he needs love and support because he never got it isn‚Äôt worth endangering your life.

His mental illness is not your responsibility. It‚Äôs not safe for it to be your responsibility. You‚Äôre not doing him or you any favors by staying. You can‚Äôt help him, he needs professional help and even then, it would be hard for someone who knows how to help people like him to actually help.

* **The woman has a strong ‚Äúgut‚Äù sense that the man could kill her** or her children, or could carry out a serious and dangerous assault against any of them or against himself.
* 
He is extremely jealous and possessive. This characteristic becomes even more worrisome when he appears to be obsessive, constantly keeping her at the center of his thoughts and appearing to be unable to conceive of life without her. He has, for example, made statements such as, ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt have you, nobody will.‚Äù
* 
He has a history of severe or very frequent violence toward her, or toward other individuals such as past partners.
* He follows her, monitors her whereabouts, uses high-tech means to keep tabs on her, or stalks her in other ways. He knows where she lives and works, knows names and addresses of her friend or relatives, or is in very familiar with her daily routines.
* She is taking steps to end the relationship, or has already done so.
* He was violent to her during a pregnancy.
* There are stepchildren involved.
* **He has threatened to kill her** or to hurt her severely, has strangled her, or has threatened her with a weapon (including making verbal reference to using a weapon, even if he did not actually brandish it)
* He has threatened to kill the children or the whole family.
* He has access to weapons and/or he is familiar with their use.
* He is depressed, suicidal, or shows signs of not caring what happens to him. He has, for example, threatened to kill himself if she leaves him.
* He is unemployed.
* He isn‚Äôt close to anyone, and no current relationships with friends or relatives are important to him.
* He has a significant criminal history and/or he has a history of using violence or threatening violence against other people.
* He abuses alcohol or drugs heavily, especially if his habits involve daily or nearly daily intoxication.
* He has been violent to children.
* He has killed or in other ways been violent to pets, or has used other terror tactics.
* He uses pornography heavily and/or has a history or perpetrating sexual violence or degradation against his partner or others.

üö© you're isolated from friends and family. This isn't just about you going missing and not being noticed. It's that this is a very common tactic that abusers will use against their victims- social isolation. It is especially common among people with NPD.

üö©He's telling people you're suicidal and unwell mentally when you're not, creating a very vivid backstory about it that's believable. No one would question this if you don't give them a reason to.

üö©He's telling you to stay away from his store more and more because if you went regularly and then suddenly stopped, people would ask questions. But if you go less and less frequently which seems to be what he's orchestrating here, and then you stop, people won't ask as many questions if you suddenly went missing. It will seem like a natural progression.

üö© Diagnosed NPD.

üö©Threats of violence.

üö©History of abuse.

üö© ""Joking"" about making you disappear. That's not a joke. If it is, what's the punchline?

If it was me, I would go into that store whenever I wanted. 

I would reconnect with all of my friends and family and talk to them every day so that the second they don't hear for me they suspect some thing. 

I would also tell all of them the story and share my location from my cell phone with them.

I would get an Apple Watch and an AirTag and wear the Apple Watch at all times even when I sleep, and put the AirTag in my car, and give some trusted friends and family access to it so they can always find me. 

I would keep a close watch on our finances and my husband's email.

I would start squirreling money away in a place he cannot access so that you can leave.

I would make a plan to leave, either staying with a friend or family member or whatever the case may be. Like an emergency kind of thing in case his behavior escalated. I would keep a bug out bag packed.

2427,y2bnqs_is2fw0e,"Hey OP. You've already gotten some good advice so I'll move on to another point (I hope you're okay, and I'm sorry you're going through this).

I have an ex who had to get out of an extremely abusive home situation. I've heard some horror stories about some of the shit her and her sister loved through, stuff that would make anybody's skin crawl. I honestly don't like to think about it often.

And it was still hard for her to get help because she didn't want to hurt her parent. 

So first and biggest point, don't feel incapable or wrong or useless just because you're struggling with the idea of getting ahold of the police or anyone. That is COMPLETELY normal. In fact, it's something more abusive parents will use to their advantage. As a child, you don't want to hurt your parent, even if they've hurt you. As a parent, they have had MUCH longer to realize this and figure out how to use it to their advantage. 

So next, getting help is exactly that. Getting HELP. You obviously are in need of help here. Anyone putting their hands on you, let alone an adult, LET ALONE YOUR FATHER, is a direct you need help right now.. and also THEY need help. They aren't going to realize they need help.

Sorry I'm bad at talking, what I'm trying to say is that your dad doesn't realize it but he needs help. And you talking to the police/state/whoever, they may be able to get him the help he needs (in addition to the help you need).

So don't feel like you're trying to throw his life away. Making the call could help you and help you stay safer, but it could also help your dad and help him stay safer.",17,0,1665606598.0,710.0,6431.0

2444,1gncnro_lwac1ab,"This just isn't adding up. I've gone to hospital wards for mental health care twice, both voluntarily. They'll keep you for 5-7 days whether you came voluntarily or not. That's it. Longer than that and they'll send you to a long term residential treatment program, because they need those beds in emergency places so you just can't stay there indefinitely. It's also hard to just go to the long term place you want right off the bat - there are waiting lists for these things. Usually you go to a mental emergency ward, they keep you a bit, then they put you on a wait list for long term care and send you home. You go to the other place once your name comes up. Even the best insurance will not pay for a stay in an emergency hospital mental ward for more than 190 days. And long term residential care places are ruinously expensive - you'll have to sell all the assets in your name for insurance to kick in and let you stay there in most cases. For most people this means they have to sell their home and car just to afford to stay there. Anything in his name should have been taken by now, and you would likely have been contacted about the selling of those things. A year in the money should have long since run out. So if he's at a place now, it isn't a short term care one. There's just no way. So someone is lying to you about where he is, or you've misunderstood the kind of place he's at.

I also have an Uncle in a long term care place because he's a danger to others. Since he's a danger to others, they're pretty open with relatives about his care. It's so strange that you haven't heard anything. You need to call your husband and ask what's going on. Ask him if he wants a divorce, and if not what gameplan you guys can make going forward. This is just...so strange. If he's icing you out like this he may just be waiting for you to ask for a divorce. May not want to feel like the bad guy by initiating it himself.

Art is one of the tools used by child psychologists to get an idea if that child is having mental health problems, abuse, or trauma of some sort. So I'm assuming that either your husband abused your child some way and it showed up in her art or he was having invasive thoughts or delusions of hurting her and was reacting to those. I think you need to get your daughter to a child psychologist yesterday. Make sure she hasn't been the victim of abuse. Even if she hasn't been, she should have family counseling to help her handle losing her Dad. Have you told your husband's health professionals that your husband has said he is a danger to your daughter? Because if he is, they should have been required to report that, and then child services should have made you aware of that danger. Health professionals are mandated reporters if they believe some one is a danger to a child. They can't just not tell you about that and never follow up with you about that, legally.

Honestly, given how many things are not kicking in the way they're legally required to, I think your husband is lying about where he is and what's happening with his mental care. Because the way he's describing things is simply not how things are done in the system. At all. You need to start demanding answers. You're his legal next of kin, and because he's shown concern about his safety around your daughter as her guardian you have a legal right to know about those possible dangers. Talk to him. Talk to his care team. Talk to a child psychologist. Talk to his family. Talk to the companies or people handling any joint assets you have. Keep asking questions until you get answers. Do the legwork. Demand information.

It sucks, but sometimes a person isn't healthy enough to maintain a marriage or relationship with his child. In those cases, divorce and suing for full custody are the right thing to do. You need to make sure your kid has a safe, stable home. That's what matters. If that means pursuing with health professionals whether he's a danger to your daughter, past or future, then that's what you need to do. But I think you're being passive partially because you don't understand your and your daughter's rights here. You have them. You just need to exercise them. The answers to whether you can or should get a divorce are out there. You need to dig them up. I'd start with a frank, honest talk with your husband and go from there.",15,2,1731177243.0,631.0,9007.0

I've been studying and teaching self-defense for 20 years. Your husband behaved recklessly and irresponsibly. The only responsible action in this situation is to call 911, both for the safety of you and your family AND for her safety. The last thing you do is leave her alone with your child or get in a 1 on 1 situation in a compressed space.

Your husband probably fell into a common trap of thinking that women are not dangerous. This is exactly why violent criminals use women to set men up for ambushes. Sure...she could harm you guys. How did he know that she wasn't armed? But a more concerning thing was how did he know he wasn't being set up? There could be more than one person in the house or she could have had her drive him into an ambush. You can approach a person who is homeless/mentally ill/on drugs with kindness and compassion without being stupid.

I can't tell you whether to leave him or not, but I think your reaction to this situation is totally normal and understandable.

This was a very upsetting experience for you and is still immediately present in your mind. The crisis is, in effect, still ongoing right now, and so now is probably not a good time to make life changing decisions.

It is an extra layer of upsetting that you and your partner are not experiencing the same crisis. This is unavoidable to some degree, every person perceives the world in their own way, but it is stressful to have such a disparity that one of you feels the entire family is in danger and the other is not reacting with the seriousness of that perception. Regardless of their own perception of danger, the action that would have showed respect would be for your partner to treat the intruder exactly as dangerous as you perceived them to be. It was not right of him to disregard your judgement; you are equal partners in the marriage, and equal protectors of your child. If his own perception was that the intruder posed no threat, then it would be fine for him to state that opinion later, once the intruder is gone and the home is secure.

I think this event has laid bare that you and he were, until now, operating under different assumptions about handling the security of the home and the protection of your child. You were operating under the assumption that you were each acting as both sentinel and guard, each watching for danger, each responding, without hesitation or analysis, to any alarm raised by the other. He, however, was operating under the assumption that you were acting as sentinel, and he as guard, and that he could essentially ""veto"" an alarm raised by you.

There isn't a ""right"" way to handle home security or the protection of your child, but you and your partner need to be in agreement on whatever arrangement you will use. I think it's completely reasonable for you to expect to be able to raise an alarm and have it respected without hesitation or analysis until such time that *you* decide the crisis is over. I think you need to have a conversation with your partner about this issue and for you both to come to an understanding about what each of you can expect of the other. Afterward, another conversation needs to be had about the stress and pain you felt experiencing this crisis under the previously mismatched expectations. Your partner needs to understand how upsetting this experience was for you, and to acknowledge those feelings as legitimate and justified. He cannot use the argument that nothing bad ended up happening to suggest that he was right to ignore your concerns, or that you were wrong to have them. The outcome is never known at the outset.

This event has damaged the trust between you and your partner. Trust that is damaged can be repaired, and sometimes the work done to repair that trust can end up fixing more than what was broken; you can end up with a stronger level of trust than you had before this crisis. But that is only possible with work from both of you. Make the severity of the situation plain to your partner, and make sure he understands that one partner disregarding the judgement or concerns of the other is an existential threat to any marriage. That is never okay.",21,0,1672158380.0,655.0,91962.0

Unless he's put in some kind of a correctional facility there's no quick fix to this and even then, any such institution would probably be a real nightmare for him. Once he turns 18, yes he can more easily be institutionalized but the standard of care would still be awful and even getting into such a system is pretty tough. The courts generally want disabled people to be cared for by the family, the government does not want the burden. I'm guessing your family probably doesn't have the funds necessary to place him anywhere on their own dime either, and the nicer assisted living facilities probably cost more than most people can afford. They basically have to be willing to get him criminalized in order for the government to take him off their hands.

As for counseling and behavioral treatments  to get his behavior under control, that's not going to be a quick fix either, if it fixes anything. I suppose you can blame it all on your parents but that's not entirely fair either even if they are partially to blame. Sex is a force of nature and for a mentally compromised person such as your brother, he's likely had educators with sex ed routines trying to already teach him about good touch and bad touch since he was very young as disabled people are both a high risk for abuse (and a high likelihood of not understanding boundaries) and they likely have been drilling this kind of training for years for all the special needs kids that they teach. They also likely have frequent routines to teach the kids not to touch THEMSELVES in public. How do I know this? Just observing the curriculum for my own special needs kid (who is now an adult) who will require care for the rest of his life. Luckily my kid doesn't do the kind of things your brother does. The behavior we can't seem to get a handle on and haven't been able to for over a decade is his insistence on chanting foul language including racial slurs. (I say this as he sings a song in the background calling all the females in the household ""a f----- c---"". Ain't life grand...üòñ. No we don't use that language in the house. All he needed was 5 minutes swiping somebody's phone to Google ""what are bad words"" to start building a mental encyclopedia of all kinds of foulness. Yes, both we and specialized professionals have tried for years to curb his language with no success.).

My pessimistic conclusion is he probably needs to be institutionalized and that's basically going to be an awful living situation for the rest of his life that everyone involved is going to have to live with or otherwise deal with his bad behavior, and yeah it.may not all be because of his disability, but it is  at least PARTLY because of his disability, and possibly completely because of his disability if his particular brain just lacks capacity for restraint.

2570,1k7umkb_mp1jl01,"OP, I am so sorry you're dealing with this.

Your mother is likely thinking of this as he just doesn't know better, and not thinking about the impact. So I would try to talk to your mom alone- at your age I would use car rides a lot because my mom wouldn't be able to be distracted and leave until I got the hard part out, and wouldn't be staring at me because she would watch the road. 

Tell her you need to talk to her about something really important that is scary. Then say ""I'm really worried about [brother.] He's acted so strange towards me and my friends and its getting worse as he grts older. I know he probably just doesn't understand but he's making me and other girls really uncomfortable,  and I'm scared that if we don't get him help soon he is going to wind up accidentally hurting someone and the police will get involved.""

Then be prepared to give as many specific examples as possible, from yourself and your friends.

By framing it this way you're reminding her this isnt just about whether or not he ""means"" to hurt you or knows what he's doing- it's about safety for you both. Because if she doesn't get him help he may wind up in jail or worse. She can tell herself ""oh he would never intentionally do anything to hurt anyone"" but she can't deny that what he is doing will hurt people if she doesn't get him help. Like you can say flat out ""He tried to hold me down and touch me inappropriately. Even if he didn't understand or mean it, if he does that to another girl he will get arrested.""

I would then do the same thing with your dad. I know you said that's scary. But your dad will hopefully understand and will intervene,  because he will remember being a teenage boy and will realize the risk of a teenage boy who lacks the self control to stop himself and the ability to understand right and wrong. 

I would also stop bringing your friends to your house and try to see if you can all hang at someone else's place,  both for everyone's comfort and to give you a break from your brother.",18,0,1745617009.0,879.0,83710.0

I went through something similar as an adult with my stepbrother.

From our teens to our 30s we were really close but then he had a psychotic episode. He wrote me a letter about how much he knew we both loved each other and wanted to be together. That‚Äôs when our younger brother told me that he also thought he was being creepy towards me but kept talking himself out of it because who wants to suspect that of their brother.

Here‚Äôs from a woman perspective who has researched a lot of the bias women get

Men more often then not do exactly what you said. Men will base who get hired or promoted off of appearance of women. Even if a woman has better set skills but isn‚Äôt as objectively pretty as another women with less skills, she is less likely to get hired for that job despite being a better fir for it. And this is very well shown in courts and police when judging a woman. If a woman goes into court and dresses very nicely, most likely she will get the better end of the deal, compared to a woman who isn‚Äôt objective pretty and just dresses like normal. Do you really want judges in your court who are biased based on appearances? Or a cop who let‚Äôs a pretty girl get away with something? Or a boss who judges on looks on if someone is hired/promoted? No. Even I think that‚Äôs wrong, I don‚Äôt want to be judged on how I look I want to be fairly treated in any of those situations. 

Now, I also do not fully blame men for those prejudices either, because the media has shown for decades that a pretty women is a good person or better set skills then the rest of us who look average.

If a woman is in power and was to make a decision on who should work with her as a team for something, she most likely wouldn‚Äôt pick you. If you have made no effort to ever speak to her, or even look her in the face, and acts excessively shy, she won‚Äôt pick you. And it‚Äôs not because you aren‚Äôt a great fit skill wise, it‚Äôs because a team project takes communication and openness and if you can‚Äôt even look her in the face or talk to her then why would she pick someone who already has a hard time just talking to one person let alone the leader of the team project. You would do the same. 

My best advice is to seek therapy, and then also on your own find things you and women can connect too. Better yet, educated yourself on the prejudices women experience and the hard ships they have to endure as a woman. If you believe women have it so easy, then you aren‚Äôt educated on what we deal with on an almost daily basis. For example: there‚Äôs a guy at work who although is very nice, doesn‚Äôt get the hint that I am not interested in him. 3 times now he‚Äôs given me his number, even though I‚Äôve openly rejected getting his number the first time. Why I am not interested in him? Because I‚Äôm 19 and he‚Äôs 37. And that is just one of my customers, there‚Äôs easily 6 guys who do something similar either to a lesser extent or goes beyond what he‚Äôs doing. But it‚Äôs the exact opposite for guys in customer service, and I do feel bad for them because despite the ones who are excessive and persistent even after being rejected, I enjoy the compliments I get. So for myself, I try to compliment the guys who come in who I know won‚Äôt decide to be weird about it and just take it as me appreciating something about them. Because guys don‚Äôt get a lot of compliments.

Anyways, I wish you the best of luck on this journey. Just remember that women are the givers of life and if it wasn‚Äôt for your mother who carried you inside her for 9 months and then painfully got you out of her, you wouldn‚Äôt be here and no one would. Oh and if you‚Äôd like a woman to talk to who will try to be understanding and not a prick about these things, feel free to DM me.

One thing that may help is called ""shadow work,"" it's a practice many therapists and spiritual folks employ. I'd recommend looking into it, it's fairly straightforward. 

>It‚Äôs like I fundamentally cannot see myself as a sexual being that a woman would ever want, that this whole aspect of life is kept from me because of things I can‚Äôt control. 

If 99% of the world finds you unattractive, that's still millions of people who do. One thing that is important to note: nearly everything is changeable. Appearance, attitude, even your personality. You can control it, and do. Perhaps join a gym, many people find that working out helps with depression as well.

>I don‚Äôt believe that women can be good leaders. I truly believe that their judgment is clouded by catty social dynamics and the attractiveness of the men they interact with.

Most people can't. Men, women, enbies. Anyone. There's a very specific type of person that makes a ""good"" leader, so I suppose you aren't entirely wrong here. And everyone's is, for your second point here. Every single person's judgement is clouded eternally by opinions, social status, and desires. Though, considering this, what is your opinion on homosexuality?

>That I‚Äôll be overlooked in a professional setting if women have power over me because I‚Äôll be judged by my appearance and demeanor instead of by my skills and accomplishments. 

You will be. By men, women, everyone. In work, though, people will most likely dislike you if they see you as competition one way or another‚Äîif you're as ugly as you seem to believe, you actually have less of a chance of being looked down on here because of that.

>They are a woman first and (maybe sometimes) an individual second.

Let me let you in on a secret: that's how everyone is, to nearly everyone else. For women, men are men first because of what they do to us. I carry pepper spray with me because of it. I'm a minor. For women, women are women first because they're the most likely to be safe to be around. I suppose it's vice-versa for men? I wouldn't know. Too busy trying not to be hatecrimed.

>And I feel like the reasons for it are arbitrary and unfair. 

Well the reasons fall on your head, as such it is your responsibility to take up the monumental task of remedying them.

>I want a relationship and female friends in theory but I can‚Äôt connect to or respect women in practice.

Then practice. Seriously, one of the best ways to get over stuff is to push past your comfort zone. It sucks and everyone hates it, but it's true.

If your girlfriend is also living in an area where most of her classmates have left, it also makes sense that her former classmate would reach out to her to have a quick catch up, and even if she isn't I again don't see any major red flags from that. Also, it's pretty basic networking to meet someone for drinks if they're working in the field you want to work in.

She messaged you when she got there and when she got in, which even at 12 does include her travelling home. Obviously I don't know her travel time, but it wouldn't be unusual if it was an hour/hour and half if they met up after work/near her work, meaning they probably only met for a few hours. 

If this was my boyfriend, it wouldn't really cross my mind to think he's cheating (or about to cheat) or that the girl had an ulterior motive.

I understand that we can all get insecure in our relationships, especially a new one, but at the moment I don't really see any cause for concern.

2634,1lpyp0w_n0yl875,"so yeah you're learning a lesson. You can't/shouldn't control what your girlfriend does at all.  But, questionable things come up and your emotions are yo-yo-ing. Btw, once they do one questionable thing, it never seems to stop.

You're asking about how to show her your perspective. She knows your perspective. You already shared it. She doesn't agree.

So let's back up a bit. She agrees to go get a drink with someone like you said, its a bit sus. But then, she's out til midnight. Very sus. And something you didn't say is, did she volunteer info? did she just kind of pass it off like ""yeah it was a good night, had fun convos"" and not say anything? That's the biggest tell.

The only control you have is your level of commitment. So if it were me, as my older wiser self now, I'd be raising an eyebrow, but if she stayed out til midnight with a stranger I wouldn't even be wondering what happened or not. It doesn't matter at that point I'd be packing her stuff.

As a younger man, I'd be breaking it into sweats wondering what happened and then having my heart jump the next time inevitably when girlfriends who are not girlfriend material do something not-gf-material like say she'd jump a celebrities bones if she could or stay out with guy friends that she won't introduce to you or etc.

When you have a girlfriend who actually IS girlfriend material, it doesn't feel like what you're feeling now. It's easy to trust them, they have your back, and they tell you all about their day voluntarily, because they aren't doing sus shit.

You don't need ""proof"" something happened to break up. Not trusting them anymore is enough. Which btw, you don't trust them anymore.",12,1,1751470899.0,915.0,3192.0
