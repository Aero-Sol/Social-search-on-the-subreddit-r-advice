1izle46,My Dad Left Us 15 Years Ago ‚Äì Now He‚Äôs Dying and Wants Me to Take Care of Him. I Don‚Äôt Know What to Do,"When I was 10, my dad walked out on our family. No explanation, no contact‚Äîjust gone. My mom worked multiple jobs to keep us afloat, and I had to grow up fast. Now, 15 years later, I get a call from an unknown number - It‚Äôs him. He says he‚Äôs sick, possibly terminal, and has no one else to turn to.

I have so much anger and resentment built up. He wasn‚Äôt there when I needed him, and now he wants me to be there for him? But at the same time, the idea of just ignoring him and letting him die alone feels... heavy. My mom says it‚Äôs my choice, but I can tell she hates the idea of me helping him. My siblings want nothing to do with him.

I don‚Äôt know if I owe him anything. I don‚Äôt even know what he‚Äôs been doing all these years. But a part of me wonders if I'd regret not doing something.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? What would you do?

**Edit/Update:**

Wow, I never expected this post to get so much attention. First off, thank you to everyone who took the time to comment‚Äîwhether you shared advice, personal experiences, or just offered support. I‚Äôve read through so many responses, and it‚Äôs given me a lot to think about.

The overwhelming response seems to be that I don‚Äôt owe him anything. Many of you pointed out that he made his choice 15 years ago, and now that life has come full circle, it‚Äôs not my responsibility to upend my life for him. A lot of you also suggested visiting him once‚Äînot out of obligation, but for my own closure, so that I can walk away knowing I did what I needed to do, on my terms. That really resonated with me.

Right now, I‚Äôm leaning towards seeing him once, just to hear what he has to say‚Äînot for his sake, but for mine. I want the chance to ask him questions only he can answer. I know there‚Äôs a chance his answers won‚Äôt bring me peace or could even make me angrier, but at least I‚Äôll know I faced it.

One thing I‚Äôm certain of is I won‚Äôt be uprooting my life to take care of him. That‚Äôs a weight I refuse to carry. My time, my love, my energy‚Äîthey belong to my mom and siblings. The people who stood by me. Who prioritized me. Every. Single. Time. Not just when they needed something.

I‚Äôll update again after my visit.

Truly, thank you all. Your words made a difference.

**Edit/Update 2:**

The dreaded meeting is happening tomorrow. I‚Äôm not sure what it will reveal, but I‚Äôm doing it for myself. I‚Äôm nervous about the wounds it may reopen, but deep down, I know I‚Äôd regret not asking him the questions I‚Äôve always had ‚Äî questions only he can answer. My mum has been supportive, telling me to do what‚Äôs best for me, while my siblings want nothing to do with him and think I should stay away. Regardless, I‚Äôm taking this opportunity to face it head-on. Wish me the best, and I‚Äôll update soon."
1j6z84l,Girlfriend just punched me in the face multiple times,"So my longtime girlfriend just had an absolute meltdown after we left dinner from her parent‚Äôs house tonight. It all started because her dad and I were watching old family videos and joking about how her and her sisters were dressed and just really light stuff about how big her great grandpa‚Äôs nose was( her Dad pointed it out and was like ‚Äùdude had a schnoz on him‚Äù and I laughed. That‚Äôs all. I swear to all things holy. 

 Fast forward to me driving home tonight and she turns off the music on the radio that I had turned on and starts trashing me about my family and how it‚Äôs strange and creepy that I actually get along with my Mom, Dad and sister. And have a drama free relationship with them, and she can‚Äôt stand it. 

So anyway I‚Äôm reading my Kindle in the living room of my house and she goes off again, about some petty bullshit that I somehow did and I‚Äôm reading a book üìñ.  
  So I did what anyone else would do and just shut up and let her vent and get it out without giving her any ammunition to feed on‚Ä¶.WRONG F*ing Move. I took my eyes off her for a second to continue my read on the couch. And she gave me a three-piece so fast that it caught me off guard, I jumped up so she wasn‚Äôt not on top of me,  she proceeded to slap the taste out of my mouth. 
  then she blocks the front door and scream for me to get away from her while blocking the only exit to leave 

I‚Äôm in my boxers  and I‚Äôm trying to grab my phone off the floor that went flying across the living room. And all I can hear is her yelling with the door open trying to have the whole neighborhood hear this shit.  

Anyway. I‚Äôm now sitting in my car with just boxers  on with a bloody lip and I thought I asked the internet for advice and by internet I mean Reddit. 


"
1hq4eut,My GF is in a medically induced coma and I am scared she is going to die.,"
My (34M) girlfriend (35F) started having chills and a runny nose on Christmas It got worse to eventually she could not breathe due to fluid filling up her lungs. She has asthma already so it even worse from there till ambulance came and took her to the ICU where they had to put her on ventilator at max oxygen and said she has influenza A . They then put her to sleep. I am scared of losing her she is the love of my life and I don‚Äôt think I can handle if anything happened to her. Can someone please give me some reassurance she‚Äôs going to be ok.  I saw her laying there with tube sticking out of her jugular and they said they had to paralyze her. They told me it will probably be a week before she‚Äôs can be awake and that it will get worse before it gets better. They said as long as her oxygen stays above 90 she will be ok. Last I looked she was at 98. I‚Äôm just trying to stay positive but I‚Äôm feeling powerless and alone‚Ä¶ I just want to hear her voice again


Edit : Thank you all so much you touched my heart and gave me hope. I will be sure to give everyone an update as soon as I can. I will let Hannah know you all are rooting for her. She‚Äôs had a rough year like many others and was really down and I just her to know she‚Äôs not alone in this world.  You all have shown me overwhelming kindness sorry if I could not reply to all your messages but I see them and they mean the world to me

Update : they have reduced the ventilator strength to down to 60 from 100 they told me things seem to moving in a good direction. Her mother has flown in to see her. Im held Hannah‚Äôs hand told her she was loved and she was going to be ok and I saw tear roll down her eye.  

Update 2 : They said if things continue going well tonight tomorrow they will slowly take away the paralyzation over next couple of days. Her oxygen is going from 92-95. Ventilator is now down to 55. Spent the day reading your messages to her and messages from her friends and family. We played her favourite music.

Update 3: today they took her off the paralytic and said she is reacting well to that. The ventilator is now down to 40 and just now to 35. One worrisome thing they noticed is her face is really red but it may be related to her body temperature also her oxygen is at 91 right now. There‚Äôs been good news everyday so far. I remain hopeful and appreciate all the messages and comment: people have sent. I did not expect so many strangers be so honest and open. Thank you all I will continue to send updates. Happy new years to everyone 

Update 4: today they took Hannah off more of the sedation (midaz) Just now when the nurse called Hannah‚Äôs name and her eyes opened but closed again after. Such a good feeling to see her being able to respond on her own. Her blood sugar and pressure is high but they expect it to be because of the steroids she still on. Hannah is also initiating her own breaths without the help of the ventilator! They say depending how it goes overnight they will starting to take more off. Making huge progress everyday.  

Update 5: today they took Hannah off the fentanyl. She is opening her eyes and moving her whole body on her own but is not responding to direction yet.  They said she has viral and bacterial pneumonia caused by the influenza and she may have a staph infection. She has renal kidney failure. her PEEP number is still 16 . She had an adverse reaction to the suctioning of her lungs they had to bring up the ventilator to 60 but brought it back down to 35 once her vitals went back to normal . They say she still has a big fight ahead of her.  Seeing her thrash around was hard but holding her hand and talking to her seemed to calm her down

Update 6: they are moving Hannah to a different hospital because they need room for sicker patients.  The icu was starting to put two patients per room. Lots of people getting sick this holiday. Today they put her back on fentanyl for the move. They just let her rest of the day. Her vitals are doing better. They say she still has viral and bacterial pneumonia. But they may take the breathing tube out on Monday since she is breathing on her own and the ventilator is at 35.

Update 7: today Hannah‚Äôs PEEP went down to 10 from 16. She is now responding to questions and nodded her head that she could see me when I was holding her hand an. The doctor said tomorrow they will excavate the ventilator tomorrow morning and I will be able to talk to her again which is the best news I‚Äôve heard all week.

Update 8: the doctors were unable to remove the tube because her throat is too swollen they are putting more drugs to bring it down. She is more concious and thrashing a lot more. It is hard to watch as the thrashing is making her throat more swollen and I can do anything to calm her down. Should know more tomorrow no timeline for removal.

Update 9: the doctors said the area around the tube is still swollen to remove. They are weening her off the Propofol. The delirium is making it dangerous to remove as well. Hopefully she will get a good rest I put a pillow beside her head to keep her from thrashing. I will slow down on updates until she gets the tube out. Thanks for all checking on me still.

Update 10 : day 11 they finally took the tube out. But turns out 4 of sedatives had a side effect of uncontrollable movement and forces your tongue to come out of your mouth called Dyskinesia  which is the most fucked up thing I‚Äôve ever seen. so they need to administer her Benadryl to fight the side effects. Hannah is answering questions but is having a tough time with these new side effects she will need to remain in the ICU. Please keep Hannah in your thoughts it‚Äôs seems like she‚Äôs fighting like 5 different battles. I‚Äôm having a hard time keeping it together in the room and feel I am just upsetting her more by crying underneath my mask up.

Update 11: day 15 Hannah got the ventilator tube out and was not showing signs of dyskensia. Today was the first day me and Hannah were able to talk back and forth and her be ok. It‚Äôs a total 180. I told her everything that happened and about how total strangers sent their thoughts and prayers she was really touched and cried. The doctor said if she passes the swallowing test she can move to the ward tomorrow. I‚Äôm so happy right now. This has been one of the best days of my life."
1jxjlxv,"Professor has been secretly docking points anytime he sees someone‚Äôs phone out. Dozens of us are now at risk of failing just because we kept our phones on our desk, and I might lose the job I have lined up for when I graduate.","My professor recently revealed that he‚Äôs been docking points any time he sees anyone with their cell phone out during the lecture‚Äìeven if it's just lying on their desk and they‚Äôre not using it. He‚Äôs docked more than 20 points from me alone, and I don‚Äôt even text during lectures. I just keep my phone, face down, on my desk out of habit. It's late in the semester and I'm at risk of failing this class, having to pay thousands of dollars that I can‚Äôt afford for another semester, and lose the job I have lined up for when I graduate.

I talked to him and he just smiled and referred me to a single sentence buried in the five-page syllabus that says ‚Äúcell phones should not be visible during lectures.‚Äù He‚Äôs never called attention to it, or said anything about the rule. He looked so smug, like he‚Äôd just won a court case instead of just screwing a random struggling college kid with a contrived loophole.¬†¬†

So far I‚Äôve (1) tried speaking to the professor, (2) tried submitting a complaint through my school‚Äôs grade appeal system. It was denied without explanation and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to appeal, and (3) tried speaking with the department head, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care - literally just said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to read the syllabus.‚Äù¬†¬†

I feel like I‚Äôm out of options and I don't know what to do."
1le1rhl,Gf gave me chlamydia,Gf of 6 months just tested positive for chlamydia. I‚Äôm getting tested now. She went on a vacation a couple weeks ago with her friend. She swears she didn‚Äôt cheat on me and that she wouldn‚Äôt. Says it possible to just get it without sex. She lying to me? How likely is it she was a dormant carrier and nothing popped up for 6 months? Please give it to me straight. Don‚Äôt even know what to think rn 
1jqss1l,There‚Äôs a little girl that‚Äôs terrorizing my apartment,"

This is a very bizarre situation I‚Äôve never been in before. Sorry for the dramatic title but it‚Äôs becoming an actual issue now. 

For the last month, it feels like 90% of the time I go outside to my car, an 8 year old girl and her dog appear and try to interact with me. 

Sounds cute right? That‚Äôs what I thought, until I realized it wasn‚Äôt. 

The first time she came up to me, she ran from across the parking lot and said, ‚ÄúI think my dog likes you!‚Äù I thought it was kind of sweet - until she got a little too close for comfort, started repeating that same line over and over, and giggling very loudly, almost manically. She wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone until I physically walked away. She even followed me to the apartment door, talking nonstop. 

I brushed it off at first, thinking maybe she‚Äôs neurodivergent (no judgment - I‚Äôm ADHD and probably more). I didn‚Äôt think much of it, until it became a daily thing. 

I work from home and go outside a few times a day for breaks (yes, I smoke. working on quitting). She‚Äôs always out there with her dog. Not a parent in sight. 

I started noticing red flags when her mood began flipping between happiness and sudden anger. She hits her dog a lot.  She‚Äôll scream ‚ÄúQuiet! Quiet! Quiet!‚Äù and punch her dog with each word. I‚Äôve seen her drag the dog while it‚Äôs pooping so it has to walk while going, and the dog cries. It‚Äôs awful to witness. 

She runs up to anyone outside, delivery drivers, residents, other dog owners, and repeats ‚ÄúI think my dog likes you!!‚Äù over and over until they respond. 

If someone has a dog, she‚Äôll walk up to them too closely while their dogs are barking aggressively. I‚Äôve seen multiple residents literally pick up their pets and speed walk  away from her. 

People have started cracking the exit door and scanning for her before they step outside. 

There‚Äôs construction happening next door, and she just.. hangs out with the workers. They ignore her now, but she‚Äôll bring them offerings of handfuls of grass or her dog. It‚Äôs honestly surreal. 

When I‚Äôm outside and have to smoke, I now drive to a spot off the property just to get personal space. If I stay near my car, she‚Äôll follow me and stand right in front of it, waving at me in a pageant-style, fingers pressed together, wave. I don‚Äôt even make eye contact.  She‚Äôll do it for like 30 seconds, just smiling. 

If I drive into the parking lot, she sometimes chases my car to where I park.

Last week I was sitting in my car listening to music and didn‚Äôt notice her. When I looked up, she jumped up from a crouch, face pressed to my driver‚Äôs side window. I felt like I had a heart attack but also pretended not to see her because wtf lmao. 

She‚Äôs out at all hours. Last night it was 9pm and dark, she was alone with the dog. Today, it was 12:30pm on a Thursday. Shouldn‚Äôt she be in school? 

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôve never dealt with something like this before. It‚Äôs gone from weird to uncomfortable to genuinely worrying.

It feels unsafe for the dog, and definitely even for her.  I‚Äôm worried she could walk up to a weirdo and something bad could happen, or she could cause a dog fight and her and the dogs could get seriously injured.  Is there someone I should call? How do I report this kind of situation without escalating it unnecessarily? I don‚Äôt want to overstep, but this just feels wrong."
1k61aku,Is it a red flag if my gf hides their phone around me?,"Me (27m) and my girlfriend (25f) been together for about 10 months. Lately I‚Äôve started noticing she‚Äôs really weird about her phone. Keeps it face down all the time, turns off notifications when I‚Äôm around, and takes it with her even if she‚Äôs just stepping out for a minute.

She used to be more open, like showing me memes or stuff from her chats, but now it‚Äôs like the phone is some top secret device. I‚Äôm not the kind of guy who snoops, and I haven‚Äôt gone through it, but I can‚Äôt lie ‚Äì it‚Äôs starting to bother me.

I asked her if something‚Äôs up, she just said ""I like my privacy"". That‚Äôs all. No explanation.

Is this a red flag? I wanna trust her, but it‚Äôs hard not to feel like she‚Äôs hiding something. Anyone been through this?"
1h00nmp,My husband won‚Äôt wash his hands after using the bathroom at home. ,"Well the title says it all. I‚Äôve put up with a lot of my husband‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle quirks‚Äù but it all came to a head yesterday when my husband dipped his finger into my freshly cooked mashed potatoes after going #2. 
This would not have been a problem if my husband would just wash his meat beaters after going to the bathroom.

My husband seems to think he only has to wash his hands if he uses a public restroom. ü§¢ He is trying to gaslight me into believing this is completely normal and that I‚Äôm the crazy one for washing at home. 

Please give me some advice on how to approach this with him in a constructive way. This isn‚Äôt normal right? We all wash our hands at home too right? 

Ps. I did not get to enjoy my beautiful mashed potatoes and I‚Äôve been in a sour mood ever since. "
1k3y33x,How to tell my friend I think her 8 year old son is dangerous?,"Occasionally, I let my 6 y.o. daughter play with my friend‚Äôs 9 y.o. son and I‚Äôve started to notice some concerning behaviour on his part. There were three things in particular that I witnessed while they playing on separate occasions recently. 

The first was when they were playing in my daughter‚Äôs above ground foldable pool. He was trying to convince my daughter to play a game where they took turns holding each other‚Äôs head under the water. ‚ÄúA drowning game‚Äù in his own words. I stepped in immediately and told them both no that will not be happening. His own grandmother was there at the time to witness this instance and she gave him a very half hearted reprimand which I found baffling. It set off alarm bells in my head instantly but I eventually let it go under the premise of children simply doing stupid things because I remembered that games like the ‚ÄúPass out challenge‚Äù were a thing when I was a kid. 

The second instance I was not around to witness but I saw the aftermath. My daughter asked if she could go over by my friend‚Äôs house to play with her son. I asked my friend and she agreed so I carried my daughter over. My daughter brought one of her dolls with her (a cabbage patch kid). I didn‚Äôt stay over with them because this wasn‚Äôt the first time our children have had play dates by the other‚Äôs house. I trust my friend. I‚Äôve known her for the better part of 10 years. About 2 hours later I picked up my daughter and went home. When we got inside I noticed the state of her doll and was horrified. The hair had be cut off and there was marker all over it. I wasn‚Äôt upset just shocked. It‚Äôs my daughter‚Äôs doll. She could play with it however she likes. When I inspected the doll further I saw the words ‚ÄòI Kill You‚Äô written on the arm. I knew it wasn‚Äôt my daughter‚Äôs handwriting but I still asked her if she wrote it just in case. She told me no my friend‚Äôs son wrote it. I was concerned and wondered if to address the situation immediately but same as I am now I am unsure of where to even begin. Eventually some weeks passed and I forgot it had happened. 

The last and most recent instance happened by my house. My friend brought her son over to play while she ran some errands. While they were playing in the front yard I saw the boy hold my daughter by her clothes and do stabbing motions. I stopped the game immediately, reprimanded them both and called my friend. I lied and said I had and emergency to sort out and that she needed to pick up her son now. She came by and picked him up without issue. 

I am never letting my daughter near that boy after this under any circumstances even if it‚Äôs at the cost of my friendship. Still i‚Äôm concerned for my friend and her safety and for the safety of other children that her son plays with. This isn‚Äôt normal behaviour for an 8 y.o. I‚Äôm unsure of how to tell my friend these things. Should I do it over the phone, through text or face to face? She can be a bit of a volatile person at times. I remember a distinct instance where she pulled out a knife on her ex husband as a matter of fact. This is just a very delicate situation and I need some help on how to go about it because I truly think that boy is mentally disturbed and dangerous and needs help. 

EDIT: I didn‚Äôt think this post would blow up so fast but thank you for the advice. I feel a lot more confident in how I should go about this. For those of you that shared your experiences thank you. There are also some things I‚Äôd like to address. 

- I made an error. The child is 9 not 8. He turned 9 recently. Sorry for that slip up. 

- For people casting judgement on me for letting my child play with another child 3 years older than her. They‚Äôve been playmates for the past 2 years without issue. These events are very recent as of the past 3 months or so. My daughter is not scared of him and actually asks to play with him or visit him often. In all the instances I described in the post she didn‚Äôt appear to be scared and she didn‚Äôt tell me she was scared. 

- Pertaining to what I will be doing moving forward: I will be calling my friend over the phone to break this tough conversation in a bit and gauge her reaction before I even think of having this discussion face to face. I‚Äôve decided after reading through as many comments as I could I will explain to her as gently as possible that her son is exhibiting some concerning behaviour. I will tell her what I‚Äôve seen and heard. I will tell her that I think he might be in need of some kind of counseling and I will do all of that without placing any blame. I want avoid offending her because I genuinely want her to listen and not get pissed at me for insinuating she‚Äôs a bad mother or something. I want that boy to get genuine help. 

- I‚Äôm unsure of if I want to involve CPU (that‚Äôs what it is in my country) as I‚Äôm really unaware of their procedures. I need to look into it more and I will. I also cannot involve his school or teachers because most schools in my country are unisex so they aren‚Äôt in the same school. I can‚Äôt waltz in to warn teachers about a child who is not my own especially if I myself have no child in that school. 

- Another thing, I read some comments saying this post is fake due to the post history on this account. This isn‚Äôt my account. There‚Äôs your simple answer. It‚Äôs a throwaway account of a friend. I just didn‚Äôt want to make my own. Believe me or not it‚Äôs up to you. It doesn‚Äôt really change what I‚Äôm here for. 

EDIT 2 
- Forgot to address this. When I described my friend as volatile I meant it in way that I think if I address this the wrong way she can react very badly. She does have a history of reacting badly to situations that‚Äôs what I was trying to point out with ex husband bit. Worst yet if it involves her son. 

- This woman has been there for me through some very hard times in my life. She‚Äôs been my number one supporter since my daughter was born and my ex husband left us. She visited me at the hospital when I gave birth. She helped me through my postpartum depression. We have a very rich friendship. She always helped me. So consider that before judging me for trusting her with my daughter. If I have to cut her off I would be doing so with a very heavy heart but I will do whatever is best for my daughter. "
1k1qk14,How do I politely tell my boyfriend to go away when I‚Äôm taking a break from the baby,"
Me and my BF have a 3 month old baby girl. Here recently she‚Äôs been awake almost all day but sleeps throughout the night. She only takes like 10 minute naps during the day.
Every time I tell my boyfriend I need a break, he will take the baby into the living room and like 15 minutes later he come ask me if I could go watch the baby in her swing while he goes and does something. He also says ‚Äúshe‚Äôs in there looking for her mama‚Äù which makes me feel guilty üôÉ I just want more than a 15 minute break"
1lqz2hy,Got fired on my first day and I don‚Äôt know how to tell my parents,Im 15 years old and on my first day I got fired because I went on my phone to check some texts and watch a little bit of tiktok and when I got off my manager told me that today is my last day because I went on my phone. Im really stressed and just want some advice on how to tell my parents (!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) I told my parents hours ago I was just being dumb and didn‚Äôt decide to update this but I did learn from my really stupid mistake of being a dumbass but they were disappointed in me but still offered to help find new jobs for me. I know some of the comments here are very harsh but thats what life is sometimes and I definitely learned this(btw the reason why Im working at 15 is because I wanted to)
1lestoz,How do I (can I?!) tell my sister that she can't name her baby daughter Lolita.,"My sister (37f) is not the most well read person. She gave birth to a baby girl yesterday (she's got two boys already and has wanted a girl for a long time). She has just told me that they are naming her Lolita. I just... I don't know how to process this or how to tell her this is not a good, or cute, or edgy name.

We don't have the closest relationship, and I'm her older sister and childless by choice. She often thinks I'm boring or a stick in the mud. I worry that anything I say will just be eye-rolled at, or make her stick to the name harder.

**Edit to add update:**   
I've written her a message outlining my concerns:

""*Hey love. I am so happy and excited for you and the new little one. And I want you to know that I love and support you and that I'll always be there for you.*

*This message isn't meant to shame or hurt you, but I want you to be making as informed a decision as possible. I wasn't aware of all of the history of Lolita myself, so I looked it up and asked some advice of others better read than me.*

*I wanted to share some thoughts on the name, not to tell you what to do, but just to make sure you have all the information. While it's a beautiful-sounding name, ""Lolita"" carries some really strong and often unpleasant connotations.*

*As I'm sure you're already aware, it's the title and the name of the 12-year-old girl in Nabokov's book, and films. The book is about her sexual assault by an older man, and because of this, the name has become synonymous with the sexualization and exploitation of underage girls. In the book she is painted as a 12 year old seductress, (even though, of course at 12 she cannot consent) and we're encouraged to sympathise with with pedophile.*

*Beyond the book, the term ""Lolita"" is, of course, now a category of ""barely legal"" pornography. And more recently, Jeffrey Epstein named his private plane ""The Lolita Express,"" (as if the name needed any further connection to child sex trafficking)*

*I know how much thought you're putting into this, and ultimately, I will love and support you and your baby no matter what name you choose. I just wanted to make sure you were aware of these associations, as they're pretty ingrained in pop culture and beyond. Let me know if you want to talk about it, and if this is your final decision then I will say no more and will support¬†your decision.*""

Folks have reminded me that she'll be hormonal, exhausted and emotional at this point, so I'm not going to send it to her till she's settled back home from hospital, I don't want to overwhelm her with a wall of text, but I think text is the best option so she can read back through it if she needs.

I genuinely love and care for her and if this *is* a thought through decision then I will support her in it. I just really want to make sure that she has all the info that she can. She is both hot headed and strong willed, so I'm afraid that if I push she'll stick to her choice thorough stubbornness rather than a real love for the name, so any advice on the wording is appreciated.

**Final update:**  
I sent her that message and got back gifs that say 'no one asked your opinion' and 'I am searching for fucks to give' and was told that she 'doesn't give two shineys' what I think. So, I guess little Lolita is on her own."
dkftg1,"I'm Chilean, as i type this on reddit policemen are holding people hostage at gunpoint, the're entering people's houses and taking them away somewhere, the military is on the streets shooting at civilians, I'm at home i can't sleep, I'm scared there's helicopters flying over.

1inzx2o,Daughters vaping at school.,"I have 3 daughters. 15, 16, and 17 years old. Today at work, I got a call from their school. It was the principal. 

She informed me that she walked in on all three of them vaping together. I thought I was dreaming. I expected much better from them.

I stayed home today. So I chose to look through their rooms. I used to always respect their privacy up until this moment. I found a phone I didn't even realize was in my middle child's room. It didn't have a pass code so I went through it. Apparently she had a boyfriend from another state I didn't know about. I don't mind her dating but her hiding it from me broke my trust. I found a diary in my youngest's room, I don't know the pass code to it though. My oldest had a lot of vapes and even alcohol in there.

I messaged my youngest. She admitted she did it out of pressure from her sisters. She told us her sisters have (if it matters, our oldest works at McDonald's and our middle works at Dunkin Donuts) also vaped at work, and our middle almost got fired for it.

My husband is freaking out about this. Where did we go wrong? We constantly give them unconditional love, we don't force them to do anything, and we never exposed them to any kind of substances. I don't understand why they started doing it.

They get home in an hour. Please help. How do I talk to them.



INFO: Because people were wondering a few things I'll awnser 
1. I don't think she knows her boyfriend in real life. 
2. My middle child has sent pictures. Not nude pictures, but innapropriate to say the least
3. These aren't a few vapes I found. I found atleast 5 alcohol bottles under my eldest's bed, and nearly 100 vapes hidden inside my eldest's room
4. All of my children have phones. But I've never seen this before. I never purchased this. She never informed me about this.
5. My children have never had behavioral issues. They were always well behaved. My oldest has had some issues back in middle school but has been fine since. My youngest is in honor society and is her grade's class president.
6. They should be home in around 10 minutes. Their bus is extremely late.



EDIT: They are officially 2 minutes away. I will be updating on this. 




FINAL UPDATE:
I appreciate everyone's commentary. I have spoken to my children. Here is what happened.


- My two oldest kids have received ISS for a week, however my youngest was able to get her way out of it.
- I have taken my middle child's phone, both of them. We both mutually agreed to delete her Snapchat account, delete tiktok, and deactivate her Instagram account. She admitted she has been wanting to do so for some time.
- My middle child blocked her ""boyfriend"" she says she knows he never downloaded or screenshotted her nudes because ""Snapchat shows you if they do"". I spoke to her about internet safety. 
- My oldest is NOT a dealer. She told me she's been addicted for a while. She was afraid to admit to me, but she's been experiencing major anxiety and depression. I listened to her. Me and her father decided to sign her up for Therapy and Rehab. She's okay with this decision. 
- My youngest is not going to be removed from Honor Society or Student Government. 
- I spoke to all of them about the dangers of drugs/drinking. They understand.
- All of them are taking a break from social media.
- My middle understands why I went through her phone. 
- Everything is in the trash. All the vapes and drinks.
- We have made a promise to no longer hide secrets. However, trust will still need to be built.
- My middle told me she paid for the phone herself.
- Everything is okay now. As we speak my kids are eating healthy together in my oldest's room.having a good time laughing. No phones, no drugs, nothing. They will receive their phones back soon.
- Almost forgot to add, my middle told me those pictures were fake! They were found online, she found someone with a similar body type and skin tone to her's and sent them. 
 

I appreciate all of the comments helping me. Thank all of you so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
fo3l6h,"I'm gonna be exposed to COVID-19, what should I do to minimize my risks?","I can't believe on the stupidity of this situation, but here we go.   

My parents at home just told me my aunt is coming to stay a few days, and I have to spare my room for her to use. I'm usually pretty chill about this, but here's the thing: That aunt is a **confirmed** carrier of Corona virus, yet shes coming here and my parents are okay with it...? WTF?  

As to how exactly she's allowed to travel: she's **not.** This is Illegal and dangerous but it seems i have no say on the matter... my only hope is to avoid getting infected. I need help, what should I do with an infected person on the house?

// Update #1

Due to the amount of advices saying that I should report this, I really feel the need to now. I'm typing this as she's on a plane, on her way here, so avoiding that is no longer possible... 

I will contact the local police department, they should be here before she arrives and I'm definitely getting into trouble... But if i think really hard about it, my parents caused this, not me. It's easier that way.

// Update #2

So... This escalated quickly. I called the non emergency line and told them a family member was coming to the house and they were a carrier of Corona. My city is on a lockdown since the growing cases of the last week so I expected the police to come over stay with us until aunt arrives, and they would tell us what to do. Not so...

Police arrived, took my parents for interrogation and one of them told me my aunt is being intercepted. Holy, fuck.

I'm alone in my house now, it's night, and looks like they're not gonna be here til tomorrow. I think updates will stop for now but for sure I won't be seeing aunt so soon. Might have been the right thing to do but I'm definitely screwed... In a month from now I might be here on the sub again asking how do I adapt to a new home, I'm 20 and I have a day job so my chances of getting kicked out after this are really high :(

Thank you for all the advice. No doubt, it was the best course of action.

// Post storm update #3

Aunt is being kept at the hospital, she indeed has the virus, and i don't know yet if shes gonna be fined for the trip or not, but I imagine she will : / 

For those asking, she's not here to just visit, she came *because* of the symptoms. She wanted family contact cause she feared not having another chance (an over reaction, i know).

I haven't been kicked out, but parents are not talking to me. To those sending lovely messages saying I should already have my own house: I'm not rich, I pay for my own food and transport and the only things I get from this house are the roof and people to talk to during breakfast as I work during the day and study at night. I don't hate my parents, they're good people, just clueless when it comes to common sense sometimes.

So that's it, crisis averted. I'm not getting infected by this god awful virus and aunt should be ok in a week, back to her home to pay the debts. I'll try cooking some nice things and bringing some god news to the table more frequently so my parents forget about this episode, but thanks for all the support in the majority of the comments, good to know this went a lot smoother than hiding in my own house.

9z2jff,"My brother, who *hated* religion, died Saturday. I just found out our recently ultra-religious mother plans to have his funeral in her Roman Catholic faith... and I ""cannot"" be a pallbearer unless I carry his body to and from the altar.","I need some advice.¬† I am so outraged, so livid, that I actually have been spluttering when trying to talk about it.

My little brother died Saturday after a 3 year battle with cancer.

TL;DR:¬† My brother (and I) hate(d) religion, and his burial ceremony is to be conducted in the Roman Catholic tradition because our mother ""found"" god in the last half decade.¬† I feel this is an incredible disrespect to his memory.¬† I will be unable to be a pallbearer unless I participate in the Mass.

Atheists, do *not* downvote those whom are religious.¬† Religious types, return the favor please, and do not downvote those opinions you disagree with.¬† Be civil.

Details:

He was exceedingly anti-religious throughout his life.¬† Not militantly atheist, where he wanted to tear down all religions and etc, but actively detested religion broadly because of the thought control and hypocrisy of it.

He hated how religion preached peace... *except kill all who do not believe the correct way.*

¬†He hated how religion preached understanding...¬† *unless someone thought differently*

He hated how religion preached love... *unless you didn't bow down, and then eternal torment*.

He hated how religion always seemed to act exactly like the leaders of North Korea... act like you love me, do what I say, or forever be imprisoned and tortured.

He hated how religion said one could rape, murder, destroy lives... *but as long as you said sorry at some point it was all good*.

He hated how religious ""leaders"" could molest children, but it was all good because they spoke for the ""invisible sky wizard"".

And yet if you lived your life being the most generous, loving, giving person to the point of sacrificing yourself for the betterment of others... you were still allegedly going to be tortured for eternity simply because you did such things because they are the way any of us should be, instead of because Bugs Bunny said we should, and needs must worship Daffy Duck.

My little brother, my best friend throughout my life, the person I have fought beside against the world of both far-right and far-left racism, idiocy, hypocrisy, and hate...

...is to be buried in a Roman Catholic Mass/ceremony, because our mother.¬† A mother that until 5 years or so was non-religious (not anti, like Brother and I, but scoffed at it) until she moved to Oregon where her sister lives (and whose son is a Roman Catholic Father/priest).

So, the advice I need:

As mentioned... I am outraged and very, very, very, *very*, *VERY* appalled and angry.¬† I feel that this is an extreme insult to my brother's memory.

I will conduct myself with utmost propriety, despite my inclinations to shout out how much my brother would hate what is going on ""in his honor"".¬† Heck, if there is ever to be a zombie uprising, this would set it off... as Brother would burst out if his casket if he could.

I will be approached by my mother and asked if I have ""calmed down""/accepted Jesus Christ since being notified that Brother will be laid to rest with full Roman Catholic ceremony.

I plan on asking her if *she* would have ""calmed down"" and accepted Muhammed if Aunt Gail (my aunt, her sister) was buried in the Muslim faith. 

I don't want this to be a shitshow.¬† The only person I have ever unconditionally loved -and who unconditionally loved me back- is dead.

I do not want to profane his memory... and yet, the very ""ceremony"" for his funeral is exactly that.

I think I will just *seethe*, and go along with it.¬† Any sort of confrontation would be worse.

But Reddit, as weird as it may be to ask complete strangers...

g8ukix,My 14 year old sister is in a ‚Äònon sexual relationship‚Äô with a 23 year old man and I‚Äôm the only one in my family who sees this as a problem...,"They met through a summer camp two years ago, as he was one of her group leaders. They became ‚Äòfriends‚Äô and exchanged phone numbers. Sometime within the past few months, they‚Äôve begun ‚Äòdating‚Äô according to my sister. They apparently confessed their feelings for one another over a phone call and he proceeded to ask her out. She accepted and proudly refers to this creep as her boyfriend. 

My parents seem to have no problem with this whatsoever. My Dad initially was concerned and as angry as I am but I believe the combination of my mother talking to him / my father actually meeting the perv brainwashed my Dad into seeing things in a different way. I‚Äôve brought up my concerns on multiple occasions but my parents constantly shut me down and have even accused me of causing unnecessary tension and trying to destroy a ‚Äòpure relationship‚Äô. 

I‚Äôve considered going to the police but the fact is they aren‚Äôt having sex. I know this for a fact because my sister and the sicko are never left alone. He apparently made a promise to my parents that he‚Äôs willing to wait as long as possible if it means he can remain my sisters boyfriend. For whatever reason, they fall right into this bullshit and act like they want what‚Äôs best for my sister.

I probably didn‚Äôt explain enough but I‚Äôm just so utterly lost, angry, confused, ect. I honestly can‚Äôt even put into words how I really feel. I‚Äôm her 22 year old brother and I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders to save her from this sick freak. I know talking to my sister won‚Äôt do anything, my parents are a lost cause, and I simply don‚Äôt have any evidence of legal wrongdoing. All I know is this will not end well if something doesn‚Äôt happen. I love my parents but I‚Äôll be the first to admit they are beyond wack.

I want to believe they are choosing to see this as a ‚Äòphase‚Äô in her life or are secretly plotting to catch the guy but deep down I know that‚Äôs not the case. They truly believe he‚Äôs a good guy and possibly their future son in law which just makes me ill to even think about."
1iaeynp,I ruined my life by seeing a prostitute,"Hi, english is not my first language but i Will try to explain everything.
I am 31 years old, and i never had a girlfriend. I had problems when i was Younger, i suffered bullying, anxiety, and then social phobia( i don't want to make excuses or justify what i did). I always considered myself a good person, but last year i was on my lowest point and i did a poor decisi√≥n and i Lost my virginity to a prostitute. I regreted so much. I think i ruined my life. 
My dream was having a girlfriend and then create a family. The worst thing is after what i did i know that i was not looking for sex, i was looking for love. It's over.
Couple a weeks ago, i could save some money, around 1000‚Ç¨(i don't have a good job so i can not save a lot). So, i went to the same woman, and i gave her the money, i told her that i was so sorry for what i did, and that i didn't expect her to forgive me and no amount of money could forgive that i did. Obviously she was surprised, said thank you, we cried, hugged me, and we talked a little bit, then i left, and i felt kind of better, but on the other hand i felt much much worst, because i couldn't imagine how i was able to do that. I managed a little bit to move forward.
 Right now i am stucked, i know that having a girlfriend would be difficult because of my past, but i have this Desire inside of me, at least to try It. The thing is, if someday i have a date, i could not hide my past on the first date, i just couldn't. And on the other hand i just hope i don't have a date, because i feel so ashamed.

I just need some advices, what would you do in my case? I am so lost. 

Thank you everyone for those kind words.

9obihr,Should I tell my girlfriend it was me who got her sister pregnant?,"So a bit of back story; 

Been with my current gf 6 years. Happy relationship etc.

One night I was going with her to a family party but she ended up being called into work. As I am still close with her family I decided I'd still go knowing she would meet me there later.

A few hours passed and my gf rang and said she was going to have to stay in all night. 

I ended up getting super drunk with her sister (around my age) and we ended up having unprotected sex. In the morning we both agreed it was stupid and we would keep our mouths shut so we didn't break up the family. 

Anyway now she is pregnant and told everyone else it was a ""one night stand"" but it is confirmed mine.

My gf is so excited for her sister to have the baby and it's driving me insane.

What do I do?


#Also;

sister is keeping the baby but is not interested in me being a "" dad "" to it. Family is quite rich so I don't think she will have any issues supporting the child.


#Also; 

no DNA test done but sister claims I have been only sexual contact within time period needed to impregnate.

#Also; 

How would I even tell her?

Thanks for the gold? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1jl9qoe,My gf drunkenly kissed her co-worker.,"I‚Äôm 23(M) she is 21 (F) to provide some background we‚Äôve been dating for 6 years now and have been friends for 10. I am the only long term relationship she has ever been in. she is a night shift nurse and I am in my final semester of college. She has recently found a group of friends at her job and I‚Äôve been really happy for her because I understand that they are able to understand and relate to her in ways that I can‚Äôt. I went out of town for the weekend to do some stuff with family and she ended up going bar hopping with her group. They ended up back at one of the couples apartments and continued partying she said she passed out drunk and woke up late at night and her and one of her co workers ended up talking about some deep stuff ( one of her friends recently passed away from OD ) she said mid conversation he called her beautiful and that she kissed him and they made out for a couple seconds. She claims she was incredibly intoxicated and didn‚Äôt have impulse control at that moment and regretted it the second she realized what she‚Äôd done. I came home the next day and she called me profusely crying and apologizing and admitted to me what she did. Ever since she started night shift we have had little time together throughout most weeks as our schedules are exact opposites and on her days off I still have classes. I have had plans of proposing and we planned on moving in together once I had graduated and started work. 

I never expected to find myself in this situation. I don‚Äôt know how to tackle the situation from either side whether leaving or trying to make things work I don‚Äôt know what questions to ask or how to move forward I want to give her the benefit of the doubt as nothing like this has ever occurred in the 6 years we‚Äôve been together. 

What do I do ?"
1h6fanr,"My Dad has completely shut down ever since he found out about our Mom's affair, is there any way I can get through to him?","Our family did a 23 & Me test for fun, my parents always had small families and were curious as to their history. It was his idea of a fun family thing, and something everyone could participate in.

I, my brother (21M) and sister (25F) did the test along with my husband and my daughter (5F). Things heated up once the results came back since we quickly figured out that not all of us were full blooded siblings.

We had to do a follow up paternity test on the three of us, but those results just confirmed it. Neither my sister or I are his biological children nor is my daughter his grandchild, my brother is his only bio kid.

It's also been determined that we share the same biological father but we don't know who he is. He was a guy who lived in the neighborhood but and his family moved more than 20 years ago. (I just about remember him even existing as a kid)

To say my dad has not taken this well is an understatement, he stopped talking to any of us outright and sticks to the basement now.

Mom has been begging him to come out and talk but he won't budge at all. He barely comes out to eat and drink whatever little he can. He won't leave the house except for work, he won't call anyone or answer his phone.

He has no one to talk to about this, his family is all gone. His older brother (63M) suffered from MND and passed away in 2021 which really affected him. I do not want him going through this alone.

This has everyone on edge constantly, especially our brother who lives at home while he's going to college.

I really want to give him time, but it's been 2 weeks of this since we got the tests done with no improvements. I know I can't force him to talk, but I'm worried sick.

I'm really sorry this is so long, but I'm desperate to get any advice.

Is there any way we can try and get through to him? I know I'm not his bio kid but I still consider him my father.

Edit: I've arranged to have my mother live with her sister for the time being. Dad finally responded to us and asked for more time to process this. He's open to us checking in on him every so often."
a7xcmg,My wife is cheating. Help me...,"I (M23) have been married to my wife for just over 5 years. We have a 4 year old daughter.

For the past week or two, I've had my suspicions that my wife was talking to someone and/or cheating on me. Last night after I got home, when she was asleep I checked her phone and confirmed my suspicions.

She has been talking to a co-worker, and the texts from the past two days (previous texts were deleted) ranged from both of them saying ""I love you"" to making plans today for him to come to my house today while I am at work. While they didn't definitively say they were going to have sex, it was STRONGLY implied. There is some evidence of other sexual acts already having taken place.

I am now sitting at a Waffle house after calling in to work to say I'm not coming in. I'm planning on trying to get proof of the visit if he does come over by watching when my alarm is armed/dis-armed (through the app on my phone).

After my research, if it ends in divorce, if I can prove she has committed adultry, she will not be eligible for any alimony in my state.

I could stop them from having sex by going home and confronting her before it happens, but it could cost me a lot in the long run if our marriage does fall apart. I love her and don't want it to end, but I can't see how I can forgive her for this. Even if I confronted her now, I would always still feel the same as if she did have sex with him.

This hurts so much. I love her more than anything, and I feel like there is a hole in my chest, and lead in my stomach. I am physically hungry, but can't bring myself to eat because I am so nauseous. I can't stop shaking, I can't think straight, I feel like a part of me has been ripped out. I am terrified of what this will mean for my life, and more that that, the life of my daughter. I don't know what to do...

UPDATE:
First off thanks for the silver. Too bad my first reddit award had to be for this, but thanks nonetheless.

Huge thanks to everyone for all the advice, suggestions, and support. While I still feel physically sick, I am able to think clearer thanks to everyone. I will keep you all updated as this unfolds.

2nd UPDATE:
I just want to say thanks... again. I haven't left this  post since I created it, and I've still not stopped reading. This is the only thing keeping me sane right now. If you are just getting here, please don't think because there are 250+ comments that your opinion/advice isn't important. I've read every single comment with an open mind, and I am factoring all of them into what I do.. also it really helps.. a lot.

I have yet to confront them, as the guy hasn't shown up, and I don't think he will... today atleast. Maybe she caught on that I knew. I tried to play it like nothing was wrong this morning when I left, but damn did it hurt. Not sure if she bought it. In their texts, they planned for him to come over Thursday morning (it is currently 12:40pm). If he doesn't show up, I think I'm going to talk to her about it tonight.

3RD UPDATE:
Every single one of you are awesome. You're really helping me get through this. The guy never showed up, so here is the current plan: I'm going to act like nothing is wrong for now. After talking to you all, and family, I think I can put on to act like nothing is wrong. I'll go see a lawyer in the morning, and I talked to a PI that I'll probably be hiring. I know from the texts that she planned on having him come over during the hunting trip I have planned for next weekend, so I'm going to make sure I go, and that the PI knows. I think I've decided I'm done. I don't want to try to fix it. I'm going to cover my ass, and get out. It's not just an affair in the sense that she's having sex. She tells him she loves him, and she doesn't seem to love me anymore. I feel like she's trying to use me. She wanted a new car, and for me to pay for her to go to school, but wanted to be with him.

Currently, she left to (presumably) pick up my daughter from daycare. I'm watching the time. I know how long it should take. If she takes longer, I can guess where she went. Either way, I'm going to try to make it through Christmas, and my daughter's birthday next Friday without saying anything about this. Hopefully the PI can find evidence then. Wish me luck.

UPDATE 4; GET READY, THIS IS A BIG ONE:
So I came home, and acted normal. Everything seemed normal. We joked a bit, and fuck if that doesn't hurt when you're heartbroken, and had dinner. Sitting on the couch after dinner she asks me to pause the TV, and asks when I was gonna mention ""it"". I asked what ""it"" was, and she said she knew I saw the texts. Start the conversation.

She tells me that he didn't come over (which I obviously knew) and that she told him she doesn't want to talk to him anymore. She blocked his number. Obviously since she has done this the original plan is off the table.

I still love her. My heart is broken, I dont know if I can ever forgive her or trust her; I don't know if I can be in a relationship with her. She want's to work on us. I don't know if I am willing to or not.

She says she was talking to him because she didn't feel wanted. She didn't feel a deep emotional connection between us and he ""knew all the right things to say."" She said she told him she couldn't be with him and told him multiple times she was done with him, yet here she is inviting him to our house. She said it wasn't a choice what she felt for him. The exact story was along the lines of ""He was bagging at my register one day, and I accidentally touched his hand, and it was like electricity."" I know you're probably reading this, and thinking it's a load of BS... Yeah me too. How am I supposed to trust her? I can't see her side of this.

Should I give her a chance? Should I try to work on things? I don't know. Do I want to? Is it worth it? I have to figure all this out. I told her I can't decide now. I have to think about it.

I'm thinking about asking some co-workers (no family in town, perks of being in the Military) if I can crash on their couch for a few days. Get away from it all and think. Of course I'd come back for Christmas for my daughters sake.

I don't see any point in hiring the PI now, as I genuinely don't think she'd so anything for a while. Maybe I'm wrong. Obviously I have been before. I'm taking plenty of precautions in the mean time to make sure I know what she is doing, and if anything is questionable, I'm done. Of course I won't tell her about any of this.

This will be my last update for today. Please continue to offer your perspective and advice, but I think this is largely a decision I'll have to make after due consideration.

UPDATE 5; UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, MY FEELINGS, AND THE PLAN:
I'm going to do a little Q&A section for the most asked questions.

Q: How did she find out I know?
A: Two ways. She had a strong suspicion that I knew because when she woke up, there was a notification on her phone for a new screenshot, but when she clicked it, there was no file. She was 100% sure I knew once she found this post. Yup she's seen it, she's probably reading this now. Hi wife. We'll get more into that later.

Q: What did she say when I asked if she had sex with him?
A: She said no. I am inclined to believe her, because many of the texts, including some the last ones, he was saying how excited he was to ""finally see how hot [her] pussy is"" <---that's a direct quote from him from the texts btw. No does this mean I believe that she didn't? No. Not at all. It doesn't change how I feel whether she did or not. She planned on it, and probably would've if I hadn't found out. It'll be a long time before we ever are intimate again, if we ever are
 I will definitely have us both checked for STDs.

Q: How do I know she won't do it again?
A: Obviously I don't. If we try to fix things, I'll probably never be able to fully trust her again. She is going to have to prove that she will be 100% honest with me. Here's the first test: To my wife-If you are reading this, text me NOW; text me right now and tell me. Stop reading and text me. I will know if you have read it and don't tell me. It will be over.

Some info on the comments I've seen:
I'd say roughly 80-90% of you are telling me to lawyer up and leave her. Of that 80-90%, around 20% is actually making any kind of argument as to why I should rather just saying ""Once a cheater, always a cheater."" or something similar.
The other 10-20% are telling me to either give it a shot, or to do what I want/what makes me happy. The majority of those posters are making good arguments as to why I should stay.
Thank you to everyone that has commented. It means so much to me that some many internet strangers have taken the time to try and help or comfort me.
Also, please don't downvote people because you don't agree with their opinion. Everyone's opinion matters, even if it doesn't align with yours.

I feel like in update 4, I represented her wrongly. She was saying that she did what she did with him because she felt unwanted, but she understood that it was her fault. She knows she should have talked to me. She knows she is the one in the wrong. She says she doesn't blame me for it. I didn't push her away and make her do this. She said she could control how she felt for him (which I still have a hard time believing), but she could've controlled what she did. She let him talk her into it because I think that even if she doesn't realize it, it's what she wanted at the time.

Our marriage hasn't been perfect. We've had issues. We've had issues communicating, especially lately. We've not had a great sex life. I felt like she didn't care enough, and she felt like I didn't care enough. Neither of us tried enough to work on it. Does that mean I blame myself for this? Fuck no. Not even a little. She did this, and she knows that's how I feel.

I'm not trying to make you guys like her, I just want you to understand that I don't think, and never did think, that she is a whore that is a terrible person. She is a terrible wife for what she did to me, but in general is not a bad person.

Now, for the plan going forward:
I thought long and hard (ha) last night and this morning about what I wanted. What would make ME happy. I'm not going to make the decision to stay or leave based on what she wants. I'm not going to decide to stay to keep out family together. I have to make it based on what I want. I want to stay with her... but that doesn't mean I've decided to. I want us to work things out and talk to counselors and our marriage be better than ever, but I have no idea if that will happen.

After I knew she read this post, I knew that she knew about the SC law on adultery, and that she wouldn't be entitled to alimony if she was caught. That was my only defense. Now that she knows, I don't think she'd do anything with anyone for a long time, which means that hiring a PI now or when I go hunting next weekend would be useless, however if she's reading this and knew I wasn't hiring one, she could think she could get away with it. I'm putting some safeguards in place to ensure that doesn't happen, or if it does I have proof.

I came up with an idea. I knew I couldn't and wouldn't trust her for a long time if ever again if we tried to fix things. I figured out the only thing that can even start to make me believe that MAYBE she actually wants to stay with me for me and work on our relationship, and not stay with me for what I can do for her. I asked her if she would sign a postnuptial agreement. I'll have to talk to a lawyer still, but if she will agree to sign a contract that if we divorce, even at no-fault, she gets nothing. No alimony, no possessions except certain outlined things that are undeniably hers (her computer, her clothes, her jewelry, etc.), and no child support. (Let me clarify this because I've gotten a couple of comments about it; I wouldn't not support my daughter and I wouldn't keep my daughter from her, I'd just like to avoid court ordered child support, and give her x amount to support my daughter based on how long she has her at any given time, rather than x amount per month). I don't know how it would work, hence why I have to talk to a lawyer and make sure I can do it like that. 

I have further plans, but I will not be posting them here as she may see this, and those plans involve her not knowing about them. I may reveal them later on, but it will be long from now.

At this point, if the postnuptial agreement works how I hope, and she signs it, I think I'd be willing to TRY to work on things. I know a lot of you aren't going to like this. Maybe she is lying to me. Maybe she really is just a piece of shit... but I knew her before she did this. I knew her before our marriage degraded. I don't think she did it because she wanted to have sex with someone else. I don't think she did it because she doesn't love me. I think she did it because he was telling her the exact same things I used to when we were first together. I think she misses what we used to be, and while we will never be what we used to be, this will go one of theee ways. Either we try to work on things, it doesn't work out, and we get a divorce. We try to work on things, she continues to cheat, and we get a divorce. Or, we try to work on things, we fix problems we have had with ourselves and our marriage since we first got together, and our marriage and relationship will be stronger than it has ever been. I'm hoping for the latter.

I love you guys. You are awesome. The amount of support I've gotten has been overwhelming. I'm still reading every (top-level) comment, and message I get. Shout out to the fella that gave me my first gold, and a huge shout out to the champ that gave me my first platinum. Please, continue to let me know what you think. I know a lot of you won't be happy with my decision, or will be disappointed in me, but I've gotta do this for me.

Quick add on to my latest update:
She has TERRIBLE self image issues. She thinks the worst of herself. She's also super introverted and doesn't get to know many people. This is the first job she's had where she's been around other people in years. Of course this doesn't excuse anything, but I felt like it was relevant.

P.S. Next update will probably be after next week. 

UPDATE 6:
Hey guys. Sorry I've made you wait for an update.  Currently sitting at the bar, drinking some Jack & coke.

So we talked. We tried to work things out, and it seemed like it was getting better. Then she said that she wasn't sure how she felt or if she wanted to try. We talked so more and she said she did want to try. We had a session of counseling with a therapist Wednesday.

The counseling went more or less like this. She said she felt like she wasn't getting enough out of the marriage, and that I didn't care or talk to her. The therapist asked her some questions and she answered basically saying she could tell I did care and did talk to her (or try to anyway). The therapist kinda explained to her that it wasn't that I didn't care (by her own admission), and instead that she just wasn't happy with it and didn't know what she wanted. Well, she decided what she wanted.

Last night she started setting up an air mattress in the extra room, and I saw she had some new sheets that she had ordered to fit it. I looked at her phone to see when she had ordered them, and she was texting him again.

So obviously, we're done. We will be getting a divorce. I know a lot of you are going to say ""I told you so"", but I was 100% aware this was a possibility when I tried to work things out, and I don't regret it at all. I will look back on this in the future and know I did everything I could to fix things. I have nothing left to regret, and that makes me happy. I tried, and I can never blame myself now.

Now, before anyone says it, please refrain from calling her a bitch, or just generally talking shit about my wife. As you cant just stop loving at will, I still love her. Telling me how shitty a person she is doesn't help.

I don't forgive her, and I may never, but i don't resent her. I still want the best for her and out daughter and want her to be happy. I genuinely believe she regrets hurting me, but (at least believes that) can't help how she feels. We are done, but she is currently planning to move back to Florida with her family, which means leaving this guy too.

She doesn't think she can be happy with me anymore, but I don't really think she's leaving me to be with him. In my opinion, she is excited about the pursuit. The ""puppy dog"" love that you get when you meet someone new. I think she is damaged, and needs help to figure out herself, and her self-deprecation issues.

She will be staying here in our house for the time being, and seeing a therapist (hopefully) while she still gets the benefit of it being married to me. By SC law, we will have to live apart for a year before we can file for the divorce, but she will be leaving relatively soon.

We have agreed to do mediation instead of having lawyers involved to save us money and fighting. We still get along well enough. She has agreed that she will not pursue alimony, and I think she will be giving me full custody of our daughter if the courts accept it, but with her still getting as much visitation as possible. 

I won't try to fuck her over, as much as you guys will tell me too, and although I love you all for all the support and everything you have done for me, you don't know me, and you don't know her. She's not a terrible person. I truly believe she is telling me the truth and won't try to fuck me over either.

It's gonna be rough for a long time, but we'll make it through this. The most important thing to me right now is making sure our daughter is taken care of, and that we do what is best for her.

I'm on drink #4 now, and getting tired of typing, so I'm done for now, but if I left out any details (and I'm sure I did) feel free to ask, and I will reply to any questions, as well as updating the update to include the details I left out.

I appreciate you all more than you can know, and I wish I could afford to give each and every one of you medals, but unfortunately I can't. If anyone is in the Columbia, SC area, I'd love a drinking buddy (now or later). I'm buying... unless like 40 people try to come. Have a great day. Thanks for reading. Thanks for everything. You're amazing.

z8b2rr,I want to start calling my adoptive mom ‚Äúmom‚Äù instead of her name,"My bio parents put me (15m) up for adoption when I was born so I was always in foster homes until I was twelve. I had a teacher Janice (33f) who was my home room teacher.


Janice found out about me being a foster kid and how I wished I had a family. Janice had also been a foster kid growing up and so long story short she then became my foster mom and adopted me. 


Janice is the best mom I could have ever asked for. She has been so unbelievably kind and loving to me and I absolutely adore her. The problem is that I don‚Äôt call her mom, I just call her Janice. I want to start calling her mom but have no idea how to without making it awkward. Please help me internet strangers.


Update
So‚Ä¶.. was not expecting this big of a response. Thank all of you for responding and some of the ideas made me really tear up. Anyways this morning I went to Janice and I said ‚Äúgood morning mom‚Äù she just looked at me and started crying then came over and hugged me and kissed my forehead. I hugged her back and she said I could call her whatever made me comfortable and that she loves me more than anything. I just replied with ‚ÄúI love you mom‚Äù. 


So yeah hope this update makes someone‚Äôs day because it certainly made mine. Have a great day.

Also made a typo I‚Äôm 15 not 16 lol"
1i71i57,"My (22M) girlfriend (20F) recently got lip filler and has completely changed how she acts. If I can't put up with this, do i break up with her?","My girlfriend recently got lip filler and is acting completely different. Shes constantly acting like shes some super model bad bitch now and gives off the vibe. Constantly takes pictures and staring into mirrors. Shes completely changed the way she acts w me and isnt all lovey and stuff but more bitchy. And the thing is, I really dont think they look that good either. Thats why she kind of just throws me off. This behavior is unacceptable for me.

Tdlr; Girlfriend got lip filler, not the same. Do i end things?

Edit #1 & Update:

Clearly I did not think this post would blow up like it did, and Ive had so many questions and feel like I need to clarify a lot of things.

Question #1: Why would she get lip filler at such a young age? Answer: She won it from a giveaway sort of thing. It was fully free and didn't have to pay.

Question #2: Why do you treat her rudely? Maybe she wouldn't be acting the way she is if you treated her respectfully. Answer: My behavior with her never changed. Shes changed the way she carries herself and even the way she talks to others ( It has gotten better though over the last couple days ) 

I respect her decision, I'm not insecure, and told her I was okay with her getting the lip filler if she wanted to. I honestly don't like how it looks, and with her behavior being constantly centered around her lips it has gotten annoying. For example; We're on ft having a conversation, shes looking at her lips the whole time. Anytime we walk passed a mirror shes gonna stop and make a bunch of faces in it for a couple minutes

It's just frustrating behavior. We've been together for 2 years and have had a great relationship and honestly I don't want end things over lip filler, so Im just looking for more advice."
1gm31hl,My husband kissed another women. Not sure if I should leave him,"I know by reading the title you‚Äôre probably going to say the answer is obvious and I should leave him but it‚Äôs not that simple. My husband (26M) and me (26F) have been together since we were 15. Though I liked him for about 2 years before that. I love him more than anything. I would do anything for him. I literally can‚Äôt imagine my life without him. But something happened and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

My husband has always been a nature flirt even when we were kids. He says he doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs flirting and doesn‚Äôt mean to. This has lead to a few women thinking he‚Äôs flirting with them. But he has always assured me that he doesn‚Äôt mean to and that he loves me and would never do that to me. This has caused a slight insecurity in me but he was always so loving with me and I trusted him. 

But a few days ago he went to a bar with a couple of his friends. I wasn‚Äôt feeling well so I fell asleep pretty early and I was woken up by him the next morning. He said he had to tell me something. To sum up what he said, he got pretty drunk at the bar and he ended up kissing one of our friends, let‚Äôs call her Jenny(25F). They only kissed and both regretted it after. He doesn‚Äôt know why he did it.

I was crying throughout this entire conversation and he just said he was sorry but it was only a kiss and didn‚Äôt mean anything. Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to divorce him. Our lives have become so Intertwined that divorce would be like separating two worlds. I mean we have a house together. We were planing on kids in a few months. Our family‚Äôs all love each other and we had the perfect marriage before this. 

I told him I needed a couple days to think and he said ok and left to go stay at his sisters place. Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love him and don‚Äôt want to leave him over one kiss but knowing he kissed another women is killing me. Has anyone been in a situation like this? Should I talk with Jenny before I talk to him? If anyone has any advice please let me know. I have a few days until I have to face him again so I need help.

LITTLE UPDATE: So I called Jenny and she answered immediately. She started apologizing and I said I had questions. She said we can talk in person so yea. We‚Äôre meeting up in a few hours. Wish me luck. 

UPDATE 3 DAYS LATER: Sorry for keeping you guys waiting I‚Äôve been busy these past couple of days. I guess this isn‚Äôt really an update just an explanation but here you go. So I had the talk with Jenny. We met at a park and she apologized again and promised that there was nothing romantic going on between her and my husband. They had just gotten to drunk and did something stupid.

 I asked her to explain what happened in detail and she said that they got carried away and drank a lot. Everyone that went (it was a group of 5 people) was drinking a lot and was just letting loose. Then they started dancing but two of the friends left cause they had gotten tired and the other one walked away to flirt with a girl so it was just them. Apparently it was harmless dancing until she noticed how close they were and leaned in to kiss him. (Yes she initiated the kiss)

He just stood there then they both realized what happened and pulled away. She apologized and he just said he had to go and left. She said she just got caught up in the moment and regretted it a lot. She said she understood if I never wanted to talk to her again and if I wanted her and my husband‚Äôs friendship to end. She was crying throughout all of this and I just said I would think about what I wanted and left. 

I called the friends that were at the bar with them and the two that left confirmed the story up until they left and the one that left to flirt with a girl said that after he was done flirting with the girl my husband came up to him, said he was leaving, and left quickly and he was confused. Jenny looked sad and also left after that. So yea. That‚Äôs the explanation. I‚Äôm going to talk to my husband tomorrow and I‚Äôll uploaded and let you know how that goes. 

As of right now. No I‚Äôm not going to leave him. If everything is true and that‚Äôs what happened then I‚Äôm going to stay. I love him to much to leave him over a kiss. I know some of you are going to call me stupid and naive but I can‚Äôt just throw away a 11 year relationship. I‚Äôm going to set boundaries definitely and put my foot down but I‚Äôm not going to divorce him.

EDIT: When I said he just stood there I didn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt kiss back. She kissed him. He kissed back. And then they both pulled away after a few seconds. "
h8k3iv,Found my underwear in my brother‚Äôs room (update),"First part: https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/h83sy2/i16_found_my_underwear_in_my_brothers17_room/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Okay so first off I want to thank everyone who gave me genuine advice. I saw some people saying that he could‚Äôve mistaken my sister‚Äôs trainer bra for a sports bra, I don‚Äôt see how that makes it any less inappropriate. Also my sister‚Äôs trainer bra is like 3 times smaller than my bras. But anyways I told my mom that I found my underwear under my brothers bed, I didn‚Äôt tell her about her and my sister‚Äôs bras. She decided to wait for my dad to get back from work, so we waited until he got home. Once he did my mom told him about my underwear and they both went to my brother‚Äôs room to talk to him. My dad was calm but my mom was really mad. She demanded to see the box so my brother showed them the stuff. I could tell my mom was in disbelief. My mom saw my crusty thong and my little sister‚Äôs trainer bra and started screaming at him. In my 16 years that I‚Äôve known my dad, I‚Äôve only ever seen him cry once (when my little sister was born) but he was crying now. I left the room to go with my sister while my mom still yelled at my brother. It‚Äôs been almost an hour since this happened and my parents haven‚Äôt said anything to me. I‚Äôm in my room with my sister watching a movie right now. I‚Äôll keep you guys updated."
1gf2x4j,UPDATE: My Suspicions Were Correct‚ÄîMy Wife Has Been Secretly Messaging a 17-Year-Old She Coaches. What Should I Do Next?,"**Here‚Äôs the link to my previous post for those who wanted to go back and read it:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gahddb/i\_think\_my\_wife\_might\_be\_cheating\_on\_me\_with\_a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gahddb/i_think_my_wife_might_be_cheating_on_me_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**Original post summary:**  
For those of you who didn‚Äôt see my original post, here‚Äôs a brief summary:

In my previous post, I shared some difficult suspicions about my wife, who recently became increasingly close to a 17-year-old boy she coaches. She started making strange comments about his looks, athletic abilities, and personal qualities that went beyond her usual enthusiasm for coaching. Meanwhile, she‚Äôs become much more secretive with her phone and is often late home from practice without clear explanations. These changes have left me wondering if there‚Äôs something more happening between them, but I don‚Äôt have solid proof and don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions without evidence.

**Late update**:  
First off, I want to thank everyone for the comments, advice, and support on my original post. Unfortunately, my original post was initially taken down, and I received a three-day temporary ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was eventually restored after my ban ended. Since I wasn‚Äôt able to share updates during that time, I‚Äôve decided to create a new post with all the updates so far, structured chronologically to keep everything organized. Sorry to keep everyone waiting‚Äîthis is why I‚Äôm only updating now, and the last five days have also been a whirlwind.

**Post update 1:**  
I took some of your advice and reached out to a lawyer‚Äîwell, sort of. An old friend from high school, who‚Äôs now a successful family lawyer, happens to be visiting this week. While family law isn‚Äôt exactly what I need, I‚Äôd rather speak to someone I trust before hiring a lawyer and potentially escalating things out of control.

I‚Äôm meeting him for coffee tomorrow and will update you afterward. I‚Äôm hoping he can give me some solid legal advice without things getting too intense. I obviously don‚Äôt want her to be arrested or anything drastic like that, but I also don‚Äôt know what to do next. Right now, I‚Äôm not even angry‚Äîjust overwhelmed and in shock. It‚Äôs hard to process that someone I‚Äôve been so close to over the last two years might not be who I thought and could have been hiding something awful this whole time.

**Post update 2:**  
The last five days have been absolute hell. The title is a bit of a giveaway, but pretty much everyone who commented was right, and my own suspicions have been confirmed.

After talking to my friend (the lawyer), we agreed that I should confront her with my concerns suggest looking through her phone together just to put some of my suspicions to rest. I realise how risky this was, but we really didn‚Äôt have a lot of choice considering there was no clear proof that anything weird had been going on.  
He suggested that we meet somewhere quiet, but still in a public setting in case she decided to freak out and do something irrational. I decided to take her our local park where I sat her down on a park bench well away from any crowds of people.

When we sat down together, I told her how serious of a situation we could be in and that she MUST be completely honest with me, and that want to be on her side but the way she had been acting had led to some serious suspicions. I explained to her that I didn‚Äôt want to break the trust between us so had decided against looking through her phone, despite how tempted I was.

When I told her the concerns, she immediately got defensive and started denying everything. She called me a ‚Äúparanoid asshole‚Äù for even suggesting that she would be in a relationship with a minor. She said the fact that I would even question something like this means there‚Äôs probably something wrong with me and that I must be the one hiding something.

Honestly, the way she reacted just confirmed to me that there was something that she hadn‚Äôt been telling me this entire time and that without her cooperation, the safest bet was probably just to leave.

I suggested that we look through her phone together just to provide ME with closure and even if there was nothing to hide, it would mean a lot to me that she would just humour me and that it might even be fun to look through together and laugh at how ridiculous I was being.

She screamed at me for ‚Äútrying to invade her privacy‚Äù and that I had massively overstepped the line before storming away from me, back to the car and driving to her friend‚Äôs house to stay for the night.

I don‚Äôt know what she talked about with her friend but at around 3:00 am the next morning I got a really long text from her giving her view of the situation. The messages was as follows (the entire message was considerably long so I‚Äôve summarised it for this post): My wife - I really don‚Äôt think what I have been doing is wrong, it started with me just helping this kid with some extra practice because he was struggling to get the hang of some of the drills we had been working on in that days training session. These private sessions were becoming more regular and after about three weeks of extra training sessions he sent me a friend request to my Instagram. He wasn‚Äôt the first one of the team to send me a request and I wouldn‚Äôt usually accept them but as I was giving this kid private coaching sessions I though it made more sense.  
He started to send me DMs so I responded, because I‚Äôm not a total asshole. Ok, maybe the texts aren‚Äôt just about soccer anymore, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being friends with a kid, you‚Äôve always been super close to your younger brother and I‚Äôve never called you out for being ‚Äúweird‚Äù.

The message then proceeded to say how much of an asshole I was for trying to call her out and trapping her in a situation that would always leave her looking bad.

She ended the message by telling me that she thinks that she‚Äôll be able to look past this and forgive me for being a ‚Äútotal insecure dickhead‚Äù and that if I ever questioned her like this again, she would be filing for a divorce.

I was in complete shock when I read this response as I have never seen this side to my wife. This is not the kind, loving, respectful, and open person whom i had married and it is driving me totally insane, I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

I understand that what she was telling me is not normal and I can‚Äôt believe how na√Øve I have been for so long, but I still feel like there‚Äôs even more going on that she‚Äôs not telling me. Her long message didn‚Äôt actually explain why she had been messaging this kid so much and for so long, or why she had been spending literal hours every evening locked in our bedroom or on the sofa just on her phone.

IDK, maybe I AM just being paranoid?

Maybe this is more normal than I‚Äôm making it out to be, although this seems unlikely.

Should I still try to look through her phone anyway, despite what she‚Äôs told me?

When we had met the previous day, my friend mentioned that this was out of his field but that I shouldn‚Äôt contact the police until I was more sure of anything because if we did end up getting a divorce, and she is technically innocent, calling the police on your wife for providing extra help to a kid she coaches wouldn‚Äôt look very good for me in a courtroom.

**Again, I apologise to everyone for the late update, and I know this post is kind of all over the place, but I hope you have been able to follow.**

**Edit:** This post was temporarily removed but has now been reinstated. I appreciate all the support and advice so far, and I‚Äôll be responding to comments to answer questions and clear up any confusion. I will be giving another update on the development of the situation, thank you for your patience!"
a5kqxa,My mentally handicapped brother ate his guinea pig alive,"I am at a total loss. My brother is 22 years old but has the mental capacity of about 8. He has seizure disorder, autism, and a litany of other health problems due to brain damage at birth.  

He was playing something on his N64 I set up for him and I was downstairs playing on my phone. I was house-sitting (technically babysitting) for my parents. (Yes they are in the process of getting him in assisted living/home for adults with issues like this). 

Suddenly out of nowhere I hear a hideous scream, inhuman even. I race upstairs and my brother has the door shut and barred. Horrified, I pound on it and ask what happened and he keeps saying nothing over and over. I demand he open the door and he said no he's busy. He won't tell me what I heard was, or what happened. Freaked out, I race downstairs to the garage and grab my dad's stepladder and climb up to his window, and holy fuck. My brother is hunched over chewing on his fucking now-dead guinea pig. There's blood ***everywhere***. 

I immediately called 911, my parents, and his social worker and I don't know how to handle this. He's currently under observation at a mental hospital, my parents are pissed I ""let him"" do that, and that I called 911 over that, and I am not sure how to cope with this mentally. I mean, what the hell. 


**edit**: Lots of good advice from everyone that posted seriously. Thanks for the assurances. I will update after we find out what's going to happen to him. Sounds like he's in observation for 72 hours, so it might be a while before I have anything new to share.


***EDIT/UPDATE:*** My brother was released Friday afternoon into my parents custody, and they have already removed all traces of a pet and have temporarily removed his door. He will probably get the door back but not the lock. The eval we were given was really big and complicated but basically stated that it was probably a seizure that triggered a violent episode. If he exhibits any more violent or potentially violent behavior they requested we call 911 right away. We have a social worker assigned to us and they will be visiting my parents and brother on monday morning. Nothing else new to report, except for my reoccurring nightmares. I am also in the process of seeing a therapist and have an appointment scheduled for this wednesday afternoon for someone that specializes in family related trauma.

Thanks again to everyone and I appreciate your help!"
1gahddb,"I think my wife might be cheating on me with a 17-year-old she coaches... but I don‚Äôt know for sure. What should I do?

","Alright, I never thought I‚Äôd be in this situation, but I‚Äôm completely at a loss here and I need some advice. My wife (33F) has been acting really strange lately, and I‚Äôm starting to think she might be cheating on me‚Ä¶ with one of the kids she coaches. I feel sick even typing that.

Some background: my wife is an accountant by day, and in the evenings, she volunteers as a soccer coach for a local youth team. She's always loved soccer, and I thought it was great that she was so involved with the kids and the community. But recently, she‚Äôs been dropping weird comments that are starting to really concern me.

It all started about two months ago. She casually mentioned one of the boys on her team ‚Äî he‚Äôs 17, and I won‚Äôt say his name for obvious reasons. At first, it was harmless stuff, like ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really talented for his age‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a natural leader on the field.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think much of it because, well, she‚Äôs a coach, and it‚Äôs her job to encourage the kids, right?

But then the comments started to get...weird. Like one night, out of nowhere, she said, ‚ÄúYou know, \[kid‚Äôs name\] has really pretty eyes. They‚Äôre so striking.‚Äù I remember thinking, ""Uh, that‚Äôs an odd thing to say about a kid you're coaching."" I kind of brushed it off at first, but then more things followed.

Another time, she came home after practice and said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so much more athletic than anyone else on the team. It‚Äôs impressive how developed he is.‚Äù Again, I tried to shake it off, but my gut started nagging at me. Why is she talking about him so much?

Then there‚Äôs the fact that she‚Äôs been getting way more secretive. She‚Äôs always been open with her phone and emails, but lately, she‚Äôs been turning her screen away from me when she texts or checks messages. I asked her about it, and she just laughed it off, saying I was being paranoid.

She‚Äôs also been staying later and later after practices. At first, she told me it was just because they were prepping for some tournament, but now, even with the tournament over, she‚Äôs still coming home late. When I ask, she gives vague excuses like, ‚ÄúOh, the team needed extra help,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI had some paperwork to catch up on.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the thing that really has me spiraling: Last week, I came home early from work. I expected to have the house to myself since she was supposed to be at practice, but when I walked in, I found her sitting on the couch, texting someone with a huge smile on her face. When she saw me, she quickly locked her phone and got super flustered. She said it was ""just one of the parents asking about game schedules,"" but it didn‚Äôt feel right.

I don‚Äôt have any solid proof, but something just feels *off*. Why would she be talking about this kid‚Äôs looks? Why is she suddenly so secretive? I haven‚Äôt been able to shake the feeling that something more is going on.

I don‚Äôt want to accuse her of something so serious without any real evidence, but I also don‚Äôt want to ignore my instincts. I love her, and I really don‚Äôt want to believe she‚Äôd do something like this, especially with a kid she‚Äôs supposed to be mentoring.

So, Reddit, what should I do? Am I reading too much into this? Is she cheating on me with this 17-year-old, or am I just being paranoid? How do I even begin to confront her about something like this?

Any advice would be appreciated. I‚Äôm honestly feeling lost right now.

**Updates:**

Hi everyone,

First off, I want to thank all of you for the overwhelming amount of comments, advice, and support on my original post. I really needed some sense knocked into me, and I genuinely appreciate the community‚Äôs input‚Äîit has meant a lot during this confusing time.

After reading your comments, I took some of your advice and contacted my lawyer on the evening of my original post. I‚Äôll go into more details about that shortly, but before diving into the updates, I‚Äôd like to clarify why this post is coming out now and in this format.

Unfortunately, after posting, my original post was taken down and I received a three-day ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was later restored, but I had to wait until the ban lifted to share updates. I did keep track of each development and wrote them out as they happened, so I‚Äôll be sharing them in chronological order, just as I intended from the start.

I am posting the updates on a new post because there is so much to say, and I think creating a new post is best for organising all of the updates in a clear manner. In the update post will include a link to the original post for those who may not of seen it."
1hss60e,Husband poured cold water on me while I slept,"Feeling overwhelmed and looking for advice‚Ä¶ 

Background: 
My (32 F) husband (42 M) and I have a 7-month old baby. I exclusively nurse (we did triple feeds the first month because he was born very small and had low blood sugars and then switched to exclusively nursing because the bottles, pumping, etc were all too much for us, baby was spitting up / vomiting / etc) so we are currently only nursing (with some solids introduced during the day for texture / taste). We tried to reintroduce bottles around month 3 or 4 and baby refused. We‚Äôve tried straw cup drinking around months 4 or 5 which might‚Äôve been too early. It‚Äôs on my to do list to try again with straw drinking. We had some challenges at first with solids (he broke out in full blown hives with the first 3 foods he tried which spanned over about a month to allow breaks to recover between foods). 

I‚Äôve also had various health conditions pop up since he was born (so on going about 7 months now) that I‚Äôve been struggling to manage. We had ants a few months ago and I thought I had ant bites all over my feet and legs. The ‚Äúant bites‚Äù ended up spreading and ongoing for months and I eventually learned that they are rashes, not ant bites. My hands started to break down in rashes too which I thought was a manifestation of my celiac (gluten intolerance) so I thought it would go away because I haven‚Äôt been consuming gluten and assumed I must have accidentally consumed some that triggered a reaction. When the rashes persisted, I scheduled with a dermatologist and she prescribed some creams including a steroid and antibiotic which have been difficult to balance because I need my hands to take care of baby. I ordered cotton and non-latex gloves to put over the creams but even getting the time to go through the cream routine, brushing my teeth, etc etc has been tough because baby is so mom-dependent right now and cries a lot with dad despite efforts for them to bond. At months 3 or 4, baby would take to dad for maybe 5-15 minutes total per day (24 hours). We don‚Äôt have any other family support and I‚Äôm staying home full time currently to care for baby.

Our current routine is that baby wakes up at 6:15 am, nurses until about 6:45 am, hangs out with his dad until 7:45 am, and then dad gets ready and goes to work at 8 am, returns at 4 pm. I usually sleep during that 45 minutes because after caring for baby all night (we also co-sleep and co-nap, please don‚Äôt criticize) it is the only time I get to stretch out in bed and sleep as a solo person and can sleep on my belly or however I choose. It is my only ‚Äúme‚Äù time, and I choose to sleep after late nights with baby eating every few hours because I am completely exhausted and need the energy to take care of a baby solo for the next 8+ hours. 

Fast forward to today, I was dead exhausted this morning, and instead of letting me sleep, my husband kept insisting I wake up and poured cold water all over my face while I was asleep.

It turned into a fight. We hired someone this week (as a trial week) to help us meal prep because I‚Äôve been struggling to prepare healthy meals for myself while also caring for a 7-month old. We were still arguing when she was supposed to arrive so I suggested we ask her not to come today and we‚Äôd still pay for the day and groceries of course. He got mad saying the world doesn‚Äôt start and stop for my feelings which is true but we can‚Äôt have a stranger in our own while we‚Äôre arguing and I was still shaken up by the morning (husband smacking me and pouring cold water on my face to try to wake me up). When I mentioned cancelling today, he said, ‚ÄúNo, she is fired if you cancel her today! You can starve!‚Äù 

He says I was ‚Äúfaking being asleep‚Äù and I kept asking him not to speak on my intentions and I wasn‚Äôt fake sleeping, I was actually sleeping. Although ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù is an oversimplification. In reality, I was half asleep, half awake, half paralyzed by what was going on around me and too exhausted to even use my words, half utterly defeated by the complete lack of emotional support I‚Äôve been desperately needing. 

I know this post is all over the place, we are just struggling, and I don‚Äôt know who to turn to for emotional support. I have been asking my husband for months for emotional support and am faced with invalidation and dismissiveness and I‚Äôm exhausted and don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Any advice would be appreciated. "
l7g3e7,Does my bf have the right to be mad that I left our hotel room last night to eat dinner,"Me and my bf are currently on vacation and drove almost 25 hours without eating anything mostly because he didn't want to stop.

We got to our hotel room at around 10:30 pm and I was absolutely starving and asked if he wanted to grab dinner at the Cafe across the street and he said no. I tried to go to sleep but couldn't because of how hungry I was. I ended up going to the Cafe while my bf was asleep and got myself a burger and fries.

I get back to our room to see him waiting for me and started yelling at me for leaving. He complained that I only had to wait 8 hours more for the breakfast bar to open.

My stomach was actually hurting from not eating anything and there was no way I could wait that long. Does he have the right to be angry at me?"
1h9mp4i,"18M, my GF (F) told me she was 22, but now she says she's 29 and about to turn 30. What should I do","I‚Äôm an 18-year-old college student, and I‚Äôve been in a relationship for about 6 months. When we first started dating, my girlfriend told me she was 22. A few days ago, she revealed that she‚Äôs actually 29 and will turn 30 soon. This revelation has left me feeling confused and unsure about what to do.

I love her, but the age gap feels overwhelming now, especially since I was under a different impression about her age this whole time. As a college student with no income, I was thinking I had some time to build myself up before considering long-term commitments like marriage or starting a family. But now I feel like the pressure is on, and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it."
w6kxth,Don‚Äôt know when parents are coming home,"15F here. So a little over 3 weeks ago my parents told my brother (9M) and I that they were going out for a while to see some friends and May end up spending the night somewhere. Didn‚Äôt really think much of it at the time and but they haven‚Äôt been home since and I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

They‚Äôre not missing. I‚Äôve texted both of them multiple times now and they always respond, and I‚Äôve even FaceTimed my mom several times and it‚Äôs definitely her and she seems totally okay. But when I ask them where they are or when they think they‚Äôll be coming home they just sort of avoid the question. 

I‚Äôm starting to get really worried, especially since they now saying I should use their credit card they left here to like, buy groceries if I need to, which I‚Äôm taking to mean they‚Äôre not coming back for at least another week.

I have no idea what to do. Do I call the police? Again they‚Äôre not missing, they just won‚Äôt come back home for some reason. But my brother is starting to get worried now too. If anyone has any advice please do share it because I‚Äôve never been this confused in my life

UPDATE - I posted this update earlier as it‚Äôs own post, but it was removed as updates are supposed to be added to the original text unless they are asking for additional advice, which mine was not. Here‚Äôs the original update however:

Hey everyone. I just wanted to make this post so that you all know what‚Äôs going on now and that we‚Äôre okay.

My grandparents are here at the house with us now. They called back as soon as they got the voicemails I left and immediately started heading this way. I feel a lot better now that they are here. They called the police once they got here. They talked to them, I talked to them. All that we really did is tell them everything I said in the original post I made and showed them my texts with them. We don‚Äôt have much more information then that.

My grandpa called our dad and I think he actually spoke to one of the police officers. I don‚Äôt know what he said though, other than he still won‚Äôt tell anybody where they are. So we still have no idea what they‚Äôre doing or why they left. I promise I‚Äôll make another update when I know more. Please have patience though. I‚Äôm trying to cooperate with an investigation now. They‚Äôre bringing the police dogs over to sniff around the house and I‚Äôm so nervous and I don‚Äôt even know why.

This post is really just to let everyone know that our grandparents are here now and we are fine and alright. And I just want to thank everybody for helping out and being so supportive. And was really freaking out last night and I appreciate all the kind words. I‚Äôll update when I can"
14i79q2,Stupid but I have a problem with a seagull at work,"I‚Äôm a line cook. I go smoke by the dumpsters a few times a day. We get seagulls in our parking lot- it‚Äôs a well known restaurant, it‚Äôs busy, and tourists are sloppy with their fries. I also suspect the tourists are feeding the seagulls bc it‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù even though it‚Äôs very against the rules. Regardless, the gulls do not fear man or god. They are used to people.

A few weeks back, one of the gulls swooped down and took my cig. I think he thought it was a French fry. I giggled, and went about my day. However, it‚Äôs happened a few times since. I know it‚Äôs the same guy because he has a dark spot on his chest. I call him The Pestilence. 

I‚Äôm concerned he is now addicted to nicotine. He‚Äôs by the dumpsters at the same time as my breaks, every single day. This is obviously not good for him, and I‚Äôm getting mad about him bumming off me because smoking is expensive. Do I try to quit smoking? I‚Äôll make noise and try to appear large to scare him off, but The Pestilence is hip to my tricks. Have work crack down on tourists feeding the gulls? What do I do? Are there sonar weapons, such as a dog whistle type of thing, that I could employ? 

Sorry this is fucking stupid. I‚Äôm being bullied by a seagull. He also stole a $10 bill from my coworker. It‚Äôs very rural, so we don‚Äôt have animal rescues and animal control just laughed when we called. Any advice welcome, and yes, I am serious. He sucks but I care about wildlife and he‚Äôs probably too young to be smoking

Update: dying that this blew up. The Pestilence was off today due to rain, but I am going to get photos and/or videos of our gulls for y‚Äôall- I‚Äôm off a freakish amount next week, but I will try when I am in. thank y‚Äôall for the advice, and for the laughs - I‚Äôve been a bit down lately and it‚Äôs much appreciated. Thanks for the awards, but please donate to rural animal rescues instead- we clearly need it, their DARE programs obviously sucks. And do also donate to a women‚Äôs shelter if you assumed I‚Äôm a man- I‚Äôm just a mess of a woman, it‚Äôs easy to get those confused. And also, yes, I am a writer, and am about to try to publish a chapbook (that‚Äôs a different advice post I still gotta make tho). Once again, thank y‚Äôall - I will tell The Pestilence he has fans, but, again, he‚Äôs a terrible listener and can‚Äôt understand my accent. Have a great night, and pray for me even though we all know God is laughing at my misfortune."
tk7jvz,"My 28f, sister 35f, is demanding I either abort or let her adopt my baby.","I, 28f, am currently 19 weeks pregnant. My partner, 29M, and I are very excited, as this is our first baby and we have been trying for a few months.

We announced the pregnancy a month ago at a dinner party we hosted, and everyone seemed surprised and overjoyed. My sister, 35f, who I will call K, immediately burst into tears and asked me how I could do this to her. I stared at her, and asked ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She started ranting, saying that I always got everything I wanted (which is not true, I worked hard for all that I have) and that she knew I got pregnant just so I could rub her infertility in her face.

She screamed at me for 5 minutes about how I didn‚Äôt deserve to be a mother and she should be the one pregnant right now. My parents left with her soon after, and the party was basically over. I was really disturbed by my sister's reaction, because we had been pretty close before, and she had never done anything like this.

K called me the next day, apologizing for how she acted at my announcement and asked if we could meet up for coffee. I accepted. We met up and she pretended as nothing had happened. Then she started a big speech about her infertility, how heartbreaking it is to be growing life inside of her, just to lose it, and how she had always wanted children of her own. She then proceeded to ask me if I could consider getting an abortion, to make things ‚Äúfair‚Äù, or letting her adopt my baby. I stared at her and asked if she was serious. K said she was. I just dropped my part of the bill on the table and left.

L texted me a rant that night about how I‚Äôd made K cry, and how all they wanted was to be parents, and that this meant so much to them, and I ‚Äúowed‚Äù them for being more successful than them. I and my partner invested many years into our jobs, and we have worked very hard to earn what we earn now. I told them that my partner and I had been hoping for kids too and that I was not giving up my baby. He hung up.

She later sent me a long letter (4 pages) about how she had always wanted to be a mother, and could I consider either abortion or letting her adopt my baby, how I should care about my older sister's happiness, how she would make a better mum, how the oldest kid should have the first grandchild, and how I could always just have another baby since it was ""so easy for me to conceive"".

After that, she quieted down some, and I thought we were done with this. Except... it wasn't. She had posted MY SONOGRAM on her FB, and captioned it ‚ÄúL and I are expecting! We can‚Äôt wait to meet our little princess!‚Äù

I was seeing red. I texted her and demanded she takes the post down. No reply.\`\` I texted L. No reply. So I called my mother and told her what happened. She was able to make K take the post down, luckily enough. K has called me petty for calling my mum and has continued to demand I give up my baby. I sent her a letter explaining that I had had enough of her nonsense, I AM keeping my baby, and that I recommend she get some help. I added that if she continues, I will not hesitate to call 999.

This weekend, however, was the absolute last straw. My mum and dad have the spare key to my house, and while she was over at their house for brunch, she took the key. While my partner and I were at work, she broke into our house and stole all the clothing, blankets, nappies, bottles, and pretty much any other item we had bought for the baby, except furniture. It was later returned after my mum found it in her car. I called 999, but they told me I couldn't do anything because I had no proof and because it was all returned.

My partner and I are moving in April, but I'm still scared my sister will find out where we live and take my child. I get that she's upset and jealous, due to her infertility, but that shouldn't mean I have to give up my baby. My parents know about this, and they have been doing their best to get her some help. She doesn't want to adopt, because she wants a child that's her own flesh and blood. I'm due in August, and the stress she's causing cannot and will not be good for me or the baby. My partner is looking into a cease-and-desist letter. Is there anything else I should do or say? I'm scared for my baby.

**UPDATE 28-3-22**

The support I've received from this website is overwhelming! Thank you all for your comments, although I couldn't reply to all of them, they are appreciated! We have had the locks changed, cameras installed, and a Ring doorbell. I've started saving every letter and screenshotting every message my sister has sent and plan to take them to court for a restraining order very soon. We have also been seriously documenting everything.

My husband and I are planning a trip to Ireland for our anniversary next week, and it's going to be good to clear our heads from my sister. I've called 999 to report her for harassment, and they gave her a warning. She's contacted me saying that if I won't give her my child, I can at least pay for multiple rounds of IVF, which I have not replied to other than refusing. She's been begging my parents to convince me to give up my baby, which they refuse to do. They have also been given a statement that basically says that if they give her my contact information, they will not see my baby, to which they have agreed.

I've since changed my phone number, and we are moving very soon. My sister does not know our new address. She actually stood on our stoop for 20 minutes a few days ago, banging on our door, and yelling. My husband opened a window and told her that if she didn't leave, he would let the dog out, and threatened to call the police. We have a rather small, but hyper puppy who jumps on everyone and barks a lot, and she is quite scared of dogs, actually, so this made her leave. I started working from home last week, as did my husband, and we've followed the advice of one of the comments, washed all of the baby stuff, as well as made sure none of the food in our kitchen was messed with (none was, luckily).

We're planning on getting a restraining order as soon as possible, and are looking forward to our trip! I'm already sick of being pregnant, and I'm not even in the third trimester. I just want my baby. Thank you all again for your wonderful advice, and I may update you again when the baby is born."
iwa83b,I think my girlfriend has been trying to get my fired from all my jobs. I'm shaken. Please help me.,"
https://www.reddit.com/user/GettingMeFired/comments/j9awz1/update_on_the_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I'm M24, and I've been with GF (F29), let's call her Janice, for 2 and a half years. I just finished my education when we started dating and I have been doing all sorts of jobs since. Sometimes two at a time. I did this to expand my resume and gather job experience.

I worked in caf√©s, bookstores, a library, a grocery store and as an English tutor. Most of those jobs lasted about 3 to 5 months. My shortest stay was 2 and a half weeks, my longest 8 months, but since I didn't have a hard time applying for new positions, I tried to block it out, though it was kind of eating me up internally.

People called to complain about me, people left bad reviews about me, people used my employee wifi access to look up sketchy things on the internet under my name, former 'employees' called to 'inform' them about me, right name and all, and much much more subtle stuff that I couldn't disprove. But I was too anxious to do anything about it. I just told my girlfriend, she comforted me, she supported me every time I got my life ruined by these people. But I kept going, though they kept finding me.

Fast forward to this week. I currently hold a part-time position at a bakery, I've been working there for two months and a half. It's going okay, but my manager approached me about something regarding our google reviews.

Someone was complaining about an employee, and their description of them could only really fit me. It was on a day where we're pretty short of staff, so I could've been the only person in the store on that day for all I know. Anyway, their review contained some pretty elaborate and nasty comments about me. This has happened on one or two of my jobs already.

I told my manager that it was all pretty bogus and that someone had a vendetta against me, as it has happened before. She believed me, and told me that she'll dismiss the comment. On my break, I checked out the review myself. Their username was kinda stupid, I'm not gonna type it out here since I still work there, but I'll just call them ""Mick Myrtle"" as it was in the same range of sounds-kinda-fake-but-not-really. Anyway, I come home but don't tell Janice about it. She has heard it all before, so I didn't see the point in complaining about another time I almost lost my position.

We chat, all is well, and she leaves the room. Her phone is on the table, and suddenly, she get's a notification or an email of some sort from google. I don't remember what it said exactly, but the popup read something along the lines of ""Mick Myrtle: 'Manager' has responded to your Review!""

My heart dropped. I've been trying to ignore it since. this was two days ago. It just fit in the picture of bad reviews. It fit in the picture of the phoned complains my workplaces have received about me in the past. It fits in the picture of all the sketchy things I've been fired for.

Why would she do that, though? I'm looking for an explanation. This literally can't be. She's the only thing keeping me sane. I don't know what to do."
toq8ob,"My husband is obsessed with Destiny‚Äôs Child, and it‚Äôs ruining our marriage.","Last year, my husband discovered Destiny‚Äôs Child. I don‚Äôt know how he wasn‚Äôt aware of them before, but that‚Äôs beside the point. He obviously didn‚Äôt have this obsession before we were married. In fact, we have been married for 7 years, and he‚Äôd never exhibited any signs of obsessive behavior before this. Now, his obsession is taking over both of our lives and costing us a lot of money.
He spends all day on eBay bidding on Destiny‚Äôs Child merch. He is always the highest bidder, so it‚Äôs very expensive. He is only subscribed to streaming services so he can listen to them. He bought a Bluetooth shower speaker so he can listen to them while he bathes.
We cannot have one conversation without him saying something like, ‚ÄúYou know, this actually reminds me of a Destiny‚Äôs Child lyric.‚Äù
He‚Äôs spent hours watching YouTube tutorials, learning the choreography from every video. He makes me sit down and watch him dance in front of the TV to make sure his form and timing are perfect.
He emails the members often, begging them for a reunion tour. He has also sent them birthday gifts in the mail. I would like to point out that his obsession is not sexual in any way‚Äî he just thinks they‚Äôre really cool. 
I‚Äôm almost to my wit‚Äôs end. I feel like I can‚Äôt escape Destiny‚Äôs Child and have lost my husband completely to this obsession.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Update: My husband had an MRI yesterday. He reluctantly agreed to it, because he knew I was absolutely terrified and anxious. No tumor, thank goodness. Everything was normal. He is finally beginning to understand how seriously I take this and how much of a problem it‚Äôs become in our marriage. He has agreed to visit a therapist. Hoping for the best! Thank you all for your wonderful advice, it means the world."
a1kh25,I‚Äôm about to tell my boss I stole almost $5000 from my company,"No one even has a clue the money is missing but I just can‚Äôt hide it anymore.... I just posted this to vent and maybe help with my anxiety

I am ready for any consequences that come my way though I know o have to man up to it but it‚Äôs just stressful and hard. I don‚Äôt even know how to start the conversation.

***update*** 

I‚Äôm literally waiting outside my bosses office to finally deal with this. I understand  what everyone is saying and I appreciate the support but I gotta do what in my heart feels like the right thing for someone who has taken care of me this whole time...

I will let you all know what happens after

Thanks again all....

***third update***

 I am not in jail yet and I am waiting to hear if I am being charged.

I know everyone was saying not to do it, get a lawyer and everything but honestly I am a good person who just made a bad decision. I could have kept on hiding it but eventually it would have caught up to me. Living everyday with that dirty secret not knowing if and when you will caught honestly was eating me alive in my mind. 

It was just a matter of time before I would have been found out.

For the last couple of months I was gambling every penny I had just to win it back... 

I went to seek help today and I will continue with trying to fix myself so I don‚Äôt make the same mistake again. 

The losing after the gambling is what made me wanna die. And it was a feeling in the moment, if any of you can understand that.

I will update as everything in this situation unfolds.

If you private message me or try to chat there are like a hundred so I am sorry if I don‚Äôt respond it‚Äôs just a bit overwhelming.

ir75w1,My sister thinks I'm being selfish because I'm not putting my own health at risk to give her a baby.,"So just over 4 months ago I gave birth to my 4th and last child, It was a high risk pregnancy and the birth was very difficult, I wont go into detail as it is still hard for me think about, Me and baby are  both fine now.

My doctors advised me that it would be best to not have anymore kids and I agreed, My husband just recently had a vasectomy and is now recovering.

My sister and her boyfriend have tried planning for a family for awhile but recently found out she can't conceive, She has been very upset about this and I do feel sorry for her.

Our family mentioned adoption or surrogacy for them and even though my sisters boyfriend was on board my sister said she needed time to think.

Well a couple nights ago my sister called me to tell me her and her boyfriend had agreed on surrogacy and we talked for a bit, after awhile she brought up the fact how I had done so well in all my pregnancies and how I must have loved being pregnant.

I knew exactly where this was going and reminded her how my last pregnancy was and yet her she told me everything was fine now so what was my issue.

I told her that even though I'm around now I wont put myself through that again and just because I am fine now doesn't mean everything will be fine the next time.

She then straight up asked me if I will be her surrogate or not, I straight up told her no, she then started screaming into the phone about how selfish I am and how I need to look out for my sister and help her when she needed it.

I then told her I would help her with anything else but I was not putting my  own health at risk and potentially leave my kids without a mom and my husband a widow, My sister went on to continually scream about how selfish I was being and how much a bitch I was being, I hung up on her, I didn't think about it and went to bed.

The next morning my phone was blown up with fb messages and calls from friends and family, My sister had gone on fb after I hung up on her and she went and bitched on fb about me, She went on about how I wouldn't let her being a mom and how I had 4 kids while not being a nice sister and give her a baby, I was apparently being selfish. My mom and small handful of people are extremely angry at me and calling me all sorts of names for being selfish, while my dad, brothers and several other people are taking my side.

Everyone on my sister's side don't want to hear my side of the story they think I'm doing this for my own selfish intentions and not my health.

My mom and dad have been fighting back and forth now because my dad wont take my sister's side, and this is exactly like when were kids, my mom would always take her baby's side, I'm extremely pissed off that this has caused problems to the point my sister gets family involved.

I should not have to put my own health at risk for her.

I don't think I'm being selfish at all, but I'm not sure how to fix this

Edit 1: I will not give up or ""donate"" one of my kids to my sister"
1klhraq,Is my girlfriend too close with her guy best friend?,"So, I (27m) have been dating with my girlfriend (23f) who has a guy best friend. They've known each other for years, even before we started dating, and I get that it's possible to have a platonic friendship. But some of their interactions make me uncomfortable.

For example, they tech each other often, she bring him up in conversation a lot. She'll say things like ""Oh, he and I used to do this"", ""He said this funny thing today"", and I'm trying not to let it get to me, but sometimes it just feels a bit much

I've met him a few times, and he seems like a decent guy, but I can't help but notice that she lights up a bit differently around him, I don't know like she's just a little more animated or playful. I'm probably overthinking it, but it's been on my mind lately.

I don't want to come off as insecure or controlling, but at the same time, I don't want to ignore my own feelings if this is something that might cause tension later on. 

Should I just chill and let it go, or is it fair to bring this up with her in a calm way?"
mn7ug1,My sister has been killing animals.,"Yesterday my fourteen year old sister left her phone unlocked. I went through it and there were videos of her killing animals in our backyard. There were videos of her stabbing two squirrels to death, after she killed them she stuck sticks through their bodies. Everyone thought our cat ran away but there was a video of her holding it's dead body. There were even videos of her cutting up fish from our fish tank and torturing them. I didn't tell anyone yet. What should I do? Edit: I'm going to tell my parents once I get the videos on my phone. UPDATE!!: I'm freaking out right now. I looked through her room, and I got in her laptop because she had a journal with all of her passwords written down. She sends the videos to other people on her Discord. I have the videos saved in my phone now and as soon as my mother gets home from work I will tell her. Pray for us. ANOTHER UPDATE: I told my mom everything that you guys told me to and I showed her the videos. She said next time to tell her first and she got my sister. My sister treated most of it like a joke and was trying not to laugh. My mom said my sister needs help and made me leave the room. I don't know what they talked about. Also on her Discord there were more things. A video of her crushing a fish in her bare hands until it was split into pieces, and taking pictures of the eyeball that fell off. Video of her putting a knife directly into a large fish's eye and spinning it around. Picture of another dead squirrel's face up close with a little blood on it's mouth. I wish I could show but I don't want the post to be taken down. My mom isn't telling me what she's going to do. I don't think she'll do enough to actually help my sister. All of her devices were taken, she made a big deal about it and tried to break my mom's door."
iptz9r,I just found out my boyfriend has been posting about me on an incel forum,"I‚Äôm not really sure how to react to this i‚Äôm really in shock right now. For some context i met him through some mutual friends and we‚Äôve dated for about 6 months. He‚Äôs always liked pretty nerdy things but he‚Äôs acted pretty normal and we have a fairly stable relationship. Yesterday he let me into his email for something with our netflix and i saw a notification from incels.co. i clicked in and he was logged into his account so i browsed through. I know it was wrong to search but i‚Äôve heard and seen terrible things on that website. I figured out that for a majority of our relationship he‚Äôd been posting about me. Horrible mean things about my appearance and how i was trash and he was just using me for sex. That i was a stupid cumdumpster and i am useless. I already have really bad body image issues i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever felt worse about myself. i don‚Äôt know how to approach the issue or what to do. 
TLDR: my boyfriend has been posting horrible things about me on an incel forum without me knowing.

note that i commented but is probably lost:


thank you for all the nice advice you guys are giving me. i definitely realize I have to break up with him and now i‚Äôm just trying to use your tips to figure out how and when. it‚Äôs honestly really heartwarming that this many people care enough to give me advice thank you have a wonderful day"
1l43j4s,I 17F got a call from the Police about a work ‚Äúincident‚Äù and want me to come in to talk. Do I go in?,"I, 17F, have been working at a local grocery store for 2 years. It‚Äôs a great place to work and I really would hate to lose my job. This morning I got a phone call from the police telling me they have been made aware of an ‚Äúincident‚Äù at the grocery store that involves me, and they want me to come into the station to discuss what it‚Äôs about. I told them that I have a shift this morning, they told me to call in sick and come to the station. 

The only thing I can think it‚Äôs about is that I‚Äôve been taking old bakery items and produce at the end of the days when I‚Äôm closing. The food either gets sent away as a donation or thrown in the trash. I always make sure I‚Äôm not taking from the donation selection. The manager told me it‚Äôs okay for me to do this, but I know the owner wouldn‚Äôt approve. 

I‚Äôm freaking out! Am I going to get charged with stealing? Would I get in this much trouble for taking expired cookies at the end of my shift? I don‚Äôt even think the owner could prove I‚Äôve done this. There aren‚Äôt any cameras at the back room with the garbage. I don‚Äôt think the manager would tell on me since he tells me and offers me these things. 

Do I go in? Help! 

I told the police that I‚Äôll see what I can do about work and get back to them. 

Update 1: I texted my parents and my mom just called. She told me she called the police and that she‚Äôs coming to pick me up in a half hour to go to the station. She sounded really upset, but not at me. She told me that I‚Äôm not in trouble, but to not even call my work. What is going on?

Update 2: wow! Thank you for all the advice. I took the initial ones I read and got my parents involved right away. My mom was a boss! I have to think about what I can update and get back to you all later, because it‚Äôs honestly really bad‚Ä¶ like nightmare fuel and legally bad. I‚Äôm okay.. I think. Was at the station for hours. I‚Äôm not in trouble. It was not about stealing cookies. But it‚Äôs far from over. Sorry for being so vague. 

Update 3: 

First I wanted to clarify‚Ä¶

The police were not suggesting that I go in without my parents. They called and asked to speak to my parents. When I told them they were not home, they asked me to get them to call them back. When I asked what it was about, they told me the above. When I told them I can‚Äôt come in today because I‚Äôm working, they told me it was important and to do what I needed to do like call in sick. 

I apologize for being more clear about that phone call. A lot of you were concerned the police were trying to take advantage of me. Thank you for caring.

I was just freaking out thinking I was going to get in trouble for stealing old bakery items that the manager told me I could take. I‚Äôve never been in trouble before, so I was mortified I‚Äôd have to confess this to my parents. 

The first few commenters were telling me to talk to my parents, which kind of snapped me out of it.. and like, duh. I need to tell my parents. So I did pretty quickly. 

I don‚Äôt know what the police told my mom but she got home faster than she said and took me straight there. My dad was there when we got there. I was freaking out, even though my mom told me it wasn‚Äôt not about me stealing and to not worry about that. She also called my work and told them I wouldn‚Äôt be coming in for my shift.


Onto the update.. 

The previous manager was filming employees changing in and using the bathroom. 

An old coworker was tipped off by someone that they found a video of her on some porn website. There were dozens of videos posted of multiple girls over many years using the bathroom, and changing in the bathroom. 

Iam one of those girls. 

The only video I saw of myself, that they wanted to verify it was me, was of me going into the washroom to put my hair up and putting lipgloss on in the mirror. I know there is more but I didn‚Äôt want to see it.  

There was a whole team there of mostly female officers. Counsellors, etc. I was actually pretty impressed by how they presented and handled it all.. because well, like so many of you I don‚Äôt trust cops and they‚Äôve never really made me feel safe. 

The old manager was arrested, im not sure when but it was before they called me. They got my number from one original victim who gave out numbers of all female employees that she had. 

It‚Äôs a whole thing. i was asked many questions. I was also asked to identify two unknown victims. Like a screenshot from a video. Seems like they are customers who somehow got access to the employee bathroom, because no one can identify them. 

It‚Äôs been a lot to process. I always thought that guy was a creep. He‚Äôs the nephew of the owner. 

I fucking wish it was about pastries. 
"
mp9iig,How do I mentally and socially recover from a false r*pe accusation?,"I'm in complete mental turmoil.

Long story short, I once had a nice, roughly 7 person very close friend group, one of us had a girlfriend and after they broke up she slept with me one night while we were both drunk at an afterparty (I apologized to the friend profusely for sleeping with his ex and we are on good terms now). Now she's moved on and is dating another one of my close friends, so yeah, she gets around the friend group quite well. Around a year ago, I noticed my friend (with the gf) start to get very distant from me, almost in a mean way. After a while I asked him why, he said his girlfriend didn't want him to talk to me (Understandable on both their parts, I am the guy that slept with his gf, and she likely didn't wanna see her one-night-stand too often) I took his word for it and moved on, okay.

I later start noticing many, many people in our more distant friend group/ network start blocking me on socials or being straight up awful to me if I reached out to them. I found out that she had told people that I had R\*ped her. Naturally I was very confused as I had NOT, and we'd actually been somewhat decent friends after we'd slept together (taken classes together and went to a few more parties and whatnot). I tried to reach out to her but she had blocked me, as had all of her close friends so getting through to her would be very hard. Her friends started attacking my friends (who had been there that night and know that nothing bad went down) and it tore my friend group apart.

Fast forward a year, and that original friendgroup is down to 3 (i'm fearing 2 soon enough) all my closer friends know I did nothing wrong but seemingly left as the drama was too much to deal with, and I understand that. The word seemingly keeps spreading and there seems to be no end in sight to the amount of harassments and hate i'll be getting, I have no idea what to do and I fear that things will only get worse from here as I slowly get ostracized from everything I had been a part of.

What do I do?

Edit: I've read through the whole thread, and will continue to do so as comments come in, thank you all for your help in trying to navigate this awful situation.

Edit 2: With the exception of the friend with the gf everyone that knows both of us and both sides of the story believes me, my behavior and personality isn't consistent with this accusation, and hers is"
ktc2wi,"A Little Girl Went Missing in my Town, and Nobody Seems to Remember, What do I do?","Okay, i'm using a throwaway because this whole thing is really starting to freak me out. I live in a small town in Florida. It's pretty small, and because of that i'm close to a small handful of my neighbors. Down the road there is this family that lives there, a mom and two daughters.

I went over there the other day to see how they were doing, since it had been a couple days and I was feeling a little bored. The mother, Mary, was there, but I didn't see the girls. I asked where they were and she just looked kind of confused. She said Alex was in her room, as she was being really moody lately.

But when I asked about her younger daughter, Sandy, she just looked confused, and maybe worried? She said she only had the one.

I haven't gotten a good chance to talk to her eldest daughter, so I don't know if it's just the mom, but I asked a few of my other neighbors, and they just looked really confused, like I was spouting nonsense.

It's really starting to freak me out. I can't find anything online about this kind of thing happening, I don't think. Her name is Sandy Beckett.

What should I do? I know i'm certain she exists, i've talked to her so many times. She was a really sweet kid, and everyone just forgot her and she's nowhere to be found.

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: Woah, I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did. Thank you to everyone who is concerned about my mental state, but unless I see anything else that might be a sign of some kind of illness or break such as schizophrenia, i'm going to hold off on going to a psychiatrist. I don't want to be committed against my will if i'm not crazy, and something is actually happening here.

I'm getting alot of the same questions so I thought i'd clear a few things up, and give some more details about the situation.

First of all, I'm absolutely sure that Sandy and Alex are two different people. Alot of you are saying that they're both short for Alexandra, and I might just be remembering wrong. I've seen them in the same room together, and interacting. (I think Sandy is short for Sandra anyway.)

I'm also certain they're sisters, not cousins or friends or anything of that nature. When I first met the family, Mary introduced them as her daughters, and everything i've seen points to them being sisters.

A few of you have questioned if I've seen Sandy age over the years, and I have. She's gotten older. She even got a haircut once, when she grew tired of her long hair.

I should also probably give some more specifics about all of us. I'm 17, have lived here for quite some time, and don't really know much of a history of mental illness in my family. I don't know most of my family, so there might be, but beyond a bit of depression on my Dad's side, nothing big that I know of. As for drugs, beyond a little weed I took in the freshmen year of highschool, I'm not on anything like that.

I don't know exact ages for the girls, but Alex is maybe 6 or 7, while Sandy was around 4. As for how often I see them, it varies. With the pandemic, I've seen them significantly less, but before all this I saw them roughly once a week. Sometimes I'd go a while without seeing them, and other times i'd see them just about every day. It evens out.

Some other things I've seen in the comments include the carbon monoxide levels in my house. I'm not sure about how to check that but i'll definitely look into getting that checked out.

If anyone has any other questions please feel free to ask me. I wanted to make this a follow up post, but i'm not exactly tech savvy, so this will have to do. Later today, i'm going to head over to their house again. I'm just gonna hang out with Mary, like i've done in the past, and at some point i'll say I need to use the bathroom, and then I'll check the hall for Sandy's bedroom. I'll let you know how that goes later today. Until then, thanks so much for all your concern, but for now I just need to figure out what's going on.

**Edit/Update 2**: Okay, So as promised I went over to their house today. I didn't bring up Sandy again, and Mary seemed to either pretend the previous conversation didn't happen, or doesn't remember it. She didn't seem concerned for me or my mental health at all, which is good.

After a while of general talking about stuff; some shows we like, covid, etc, I got up to use the bathroom. Mary didn't think anything of it, so I slipped down the hall. Before going to the bathroom, I looked down the hall. The kids bedrooms are still there. I tried to open Sandy's room, but it was locked. I didn't want to be caught snooping, so I quickly went to the bathroom and after a few minutes came back out.

I still haven't seen Alex. I asked Mary where she was, and she said she went down to see a few of the kids a few streets over. I didn't say anything, but that's a really weird answer, for a couple reasons. It's a small town, but the boys she was talking about are a good 20 minute walk. I honestly cant imagine Alex walking down there by herself, and her bike was still on their front lawn.

Any photos on their walls that I remember having the family are now gone. Not edited or anything, fully removed. A few were replaced with photos of Alex, and one was replaced with a painting of a cat, seemingly done by Alex.

I'm really starting to get worried here, as any good explanation is gone, and even though Alex still seemingly exists, I haven't seen her in a while.

Also, I tried to call the school district to get any information about a Sandy Beckett, but they wouldn't give me anything, since I wasn't a parent/guardian and wasn't on any lists of contacts. Not sure what to do now besides be vigilant and try and talk to Alex. Thanks for all your support, guys, it's really helping out. I'll try to respond to more comments, and hopefully give you guys a better picture of what's going on.

&#x200B;

**Mini Update/Edit:** I'm seeing alot of comments asking about my parents. Without going into too much of my problems, my mother is dead and my father is god knows where. I live with my grandparents. And as much as I want to say that they'll be able to help me out, I honestly have never known more checked-out people in my life. I could tell them I'm doing meth (im not lol) and they'd just be like ""have fun"". They don't care much for anything around them. They don't talk to the neighbors, and I know for a fact that they don't talk to the Becketts.

Update: I'm sorry for my sudden disapearance, after the shit I posted, no less. I'm going to be completely honest here, I don't really remember writing the last update, or the post I made to r/Drugs. I'm not sure what all has happened these past few days here, but I do know that at some point I ended up getting sick. Something is wrong with my stomach, and I haven't been in the best physical or mental state. I realized I should probably update, so people don't get worried.

In all honesty, i'm just really tired and want all of this to stop. I'm scared about Sandy, and I don't know what all is happening anymore. I havent seen Mary or Alex since the last time I went over there. This isn't exactly a satisfying update, but i'm really tired and hurting all the time, and am frankly getting really tired with being worried about Sandy. Unless i find something I think is proof of something one way or another, whether im losing a few screws, or something did happen to Sandy. I just want to stop and go back to how things used to be. I'm sorry, guys.

If anything interesting happens i'll be sure to update. when I get better, i'm going to make an effort to go find Alex, but until then, I need to focus on shaking whatever bug I managed to pick up.

&#x200B;

Mini Update (not just health, I actually do have something relevant):

I'm mostly better now, still a little iffy, but with a bit more time, i'll probably be good as new and ready to keep lookin into this.

As for Sandy, I took some of you guys's advice and went on socials to see if I could find anything about Sandy. I'm not going to give out socials (obviously) because I don't want them getting harrassed, especially if all this shit is just in my head.

Honestly, I didn't look too hard, but I plan to. So far, theres been nothing of interest. Mary hasn't posted too much on her Facebook as of late, though with the pandemic, its not like theres much to talk about besides politics. I found a picture of Alex up from a few weeks ago, and it looks new, so I'm confident she's okay. Nothing of Sandy. I'm gonna keep looking, as this seems like a good angle. Only problem is theres a lot of posts to sift through to try and find anything about Sandy.

I'm nervous though about if I find a picture of her. Should I post it? I feel kinda weird combing through her Facebook looking for pictures of a kid, even more so posting it to reddit. Idk I'm just really tired and need to figure this whole thing out. I'm gonna try to respond to some more people on here, but there's alot of comments, some saying the same thing, so I can't get them all. Thanks for all the support guys.

&#x200B;

Update/confession: People found a blog. I don't know what else I expected from Reddit, but they found it, and I need to come clean. Not in the way you think, but I have been somewhat lying. 

OP does not exist. There was no neighbor. No grandparents, nothing. The reason things seem sketchy, is because I tried to do something sketchy.

I've seen those compilation videos of ""mysteries solved by the internet"" and similar titles. I thought if I tried to go about this like it was a current thing, maybe I could finally get some damn closure. I'm not a 17 year old concerned neighbor. My name is Alex Beckett. 

In 2014 my younger sister Sandy Beckett went missing. I lived in Bronson, Florida. I tried to contact the police, but they didn't care about what some random kid had to say, especially considering I had been driven by my older cousin Jr. He has been arrested at least three times, once for hunting on private property, some bullshit charge about being a public nuisance or something (he was kinda being a prick, but thats what you get from a conspiracy nut) and for something related to the possession of crack, even though I know for a fact he couldn't have had any. 

So the police weren't exactly inclined to care about me telling them Sandy went missing when I showed up in a beaten up Ford truck with the local conspiracy nut who's known for crack despite only doin weed. They basically told me the equivalent of ""Go home, honey, and leave the mysteries for your little games."" 

My mother wouldn't be much help either. She's not exactly what society, or any sober person for that matter, would call a good mother. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if she fucking killed Sandy and panicked and somehow got it to stay quiet. 

I think what worked against me back then was my age, my family, and the fact that my mom never wanted us kids to go out much. Not many people really knew us, despite being pretty tight knit. 

So as for why I did this, I just wanted some answers. I thought maybe the internet could help me. And before anybody asks why I lied about who I am, would you really have believed me if I had some crazy conspiracy that happened when I was so young? I know it wouldv'e been chalked up to some false memory bullshit. Thats not what happened. You don't forget a sister. I've forgotten alot of things, but damnit I'm not gonna forget Sandy. 

So I made this more episodic, I guess. Trying to get people interested, so they'd maybe look into this, and help me find answers. only problem is that this is the internet, and nobody takes these kinds of things as real. I've gotten a million comments that this isn't real. Well, bingo, you're half right. I just wanted people to see this, and maybe find some of those crazy internet sleuths to finally find Sandy. I don't even know if she's alive, but I hope she is. 

Please. I know I haven't been truthful, and i'm sorry. I just wanted to find my sister. I did some dumb things, but I need some closure. 

All in all, I'm sorry for any upset I may cause, and I'm sorry I lied. I hope that some people will still try and help me. I'll give any information I can to help. "
1ho6hmq,My boyfriend has an allegation against him ,"Gone
"
gnssce,"I think someone is secretly living inside my house, either that or I‚Äôm crazy. Please help.","So I moved in with my dad about 6 years ago to help him around the house because he‚Äôs getting up there in his age. Over that time I‚Äôve heard various noises like foot steps and people shushing each other. The first time was several months after I moved in. I was awoken by what sounded like my back door being closed. The door is broken and you need to slam it to get it to close properly. This has since been repaired. 

The next time was experienced by my girlfriend at the time. She claims one night when she was using the guest bathroom in my hallway she could hear footstep above her and muffled voices like a women and a man.

Every once in a while I‚Äôll hear the footsteps again and very rarely people shushing each other. These sounds originate from the area above my upstairs hallway. This area can not be accessed as it‚Äôs on the opposite side of my house from the attic access. I‚Äôve searched for secret openings and things of the sort but I‚Äôm starting to think I‚Äôm going crazy. What should I do?

UPDATE: I have woken up to many good suggestions which is a huge relief. Thank you all for chiming in! I‚Äôm at work until 5 pm EST, but when I get home I‚Äôll make sure to check the house thoroughly. Also the carbon monoxide suggestions are much appreciated I actually removed my smoke detectors years ago because they went off randomly all the time. Thanks again for all the help!

UPDATE: okay I‚Äôm off work now I‚Äôm going to grab my flashlight and start looking in my attic for a secret access. I‚Äôll make sure to keep you all updated thank you all for your ideas and suggestions!

UPDATE: I‚Äôve looked all over my house for any type of extra attic access to no avail. I went into my actual attic and did discover a space beyond the fiberglass sheets. The area is completely unreachable even for a small child. I put my phone into video mode and slid it into the space and hit record. When I watched the video I learned the area is far to confined for a person to live and I‚Äôm sure this is why the builders just sectioned it off. The area is the top most point of my roof facing East and one would need to cut into the wood in order to gain access and to what end? I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm going to invest in a CO detector and then if that doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôll check myself into a ward. Thanks again for all the replies and tips! I feel I‚Äôve let some of you down, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt get ax murdered in my sleep."
oev5mz,"Had incest with my sister in my teens. I'm getting married next month and haven't told my bride, but feeling super guilty and ashamed about it. What should I do?","(Tw: incest) Title kind of says it all. I started an incestuous relationship with my sister when I was 14 (her 13). We were from a very broken home and I suppose this was how we coped. It wasn't a one-time thing either. The relationship lasted years, until i was 16. One of us is probably infertile because I'm surprised she didn't get pregnant. 

Eventually though we just sort of stopped. We met other people and I ended up finding someone who I want to spend the rest of my life with. I never told her about me and my sister for obvious reasons. But now I'm feeling super guilty about not telling her. She trusts me with her life and tells me everything, and I have this huge thing weighing me down. I was also her first time, and I lied to her saying it was also mine cus I've never ""officially"" dated anyone before her.

I'm terrified if I tell her, she'll be disgusted and leave me. But if I say nothing, I feel like I might go crazy. What should I do?"

s6ulo2,My dad masturbates openly in the living room and it freaks me out.,"Edit: I'm not going to reply anymore, sorry. Someone decided to make a fake [post, as seen here,](https://imgur.com/a/33oM7r9) from my ""dad's"" perspective turning this whole thing into a fucking joke. Abuse/possible abuse isn't a joke. I feel sick and angry. I'm leaving this post up in case any other kid needs advice on this kind of topic, they can read the comments. If you're an adult, please realise that karma on Reddit isn't worth making a joke about sexual trauma at a child's expense. Fuck you u/adequate_sustenance. Hope the internet points bring you some artificial joy if you need it that badly. Also [fuck you for saying this. I hope you never have children.](https://imgur.com/a/cgp7b2N)

I'm a 16 year old girl. I live with my mum and dad, but lately my mum has been working late with her job.

My room is upstairs, and down stairs is the kitchen and living room. From the staircase, you can see into the living room. That's where my dad likes to spend his evenings watching TV.

Well, now that my mum isn't home, he's spending his evenings masturbating in the living room and I can see it from the staircase (I don't know if he knows I can see it, but the fact that he only does this when my mum isn't home is suspicious to me). Even when I go downstairs to get a glass of water, and I stomp really loudly on the stairs, he keeps masturbating.

What is worse is that he is verbally/emotionally abusive and he has threatened physical violence against us before. Because of this, seeing him act openly sexual when I'm home alone with him is making me really scared.

I'm scared my mum is gonna downplay it like she does with all of his abuse but it makes me sick to my stomach and afraid. I try to stomp around a lot to remind him that I'm home so maybe he'll stop touching himself but he still does it. Worse still, sometimes I can hear him moaning even with my door closed. I'll take my bath robe and stuff it under the crack in the door to make it so no sound can come in the room and I can still hear it sometimes :( 

Would it be overreacting to tell someone? Maybe not my mum because she won't care probably, she always tells me how her clients have it worse than us (she works in mental healthcare). But what if I told a teacher that I didn't feel safe at home at night? Would that make my parents angry? Would that be going too far? I'm just so grossed out and there's no way to address this without making someone angry.

I feel disgusting typing this out. Please someone help."
1jtvlio,My[F19] boyfriend [M21] of 8 months confessed to having HIV only after I confronted him about it. What do I even do?,"This is going to be a jumble of thoughts because I'm still in shock, but please help.

I've been with my boyfriend for nearly eight months and I am completely in love with him. We've had our ups and downs but we've always been willing to communicate and work through whatever's been an issue in our relationship. My boyfriend has always had a vague immune system problem that I've been somewhat aware of. All I truly knew was that he'd gotten pretty ill around his high school days and it, in turn, made his mother paranoid about his health. I knew he absolutely has to take these pills that he never hid all the time for said illness. I remember asking early on in the relationship and I swear if he'd told me they were for HIV I would remember. I recently visited him and while he stepped out I grew curious about his pills and snagged pictures of the bottles so I could so my own research - to be as aware of his well-being and such. I instantly went numb when both search results were talking about HIV treatment and I immediately texted him asking. He called me instead and, infuriatingly enough, he was defensive about why I was asking about what his pills are for at the beginning of the phone call. He eventually told me it's undetectable and can't be transmitted, and that he'd been waiting for the right time to tell me because it's ""a big thing"". Apparently I'd said insensitive things about HIV-infected people before that made him even more reluctant. But at no point did he acknowledge the principle of him simply not disclosing this to me, untransmittable or not. We've been intimate since pretty much the beginning of our relationship, most times with no protection. And this being a crime aside, I panicked and blocked him but I'm shaken, and lost, and hurt. What do I even do?

1id0z60,My (40M) wife (39F) purposefully excluded a coworker (32F) from my birthday party and then lied about it. I'm having trouble facing both of them.,"Last week my wife threw me a big surprise birthday for my 40th birthday. She invited all my closest friends, family members, and coworkers. I work in a small office of 6 people, and 5 out of the 6 were there, so in my mind I assumed she invited all 6. I noticed one coworker wasn't there and I casually asked another coworker where she was. This coworker said, ""Yeah, she couldn't make it!"" and that was it. We moved on.

The next Monday at work, I saw this coworker (32F) and we started with our usual morning small talk which includes a weekend recap. She asked me how my party was. I said, ""It was great, sucks you couldn't make it!"". This coworker just looked at me very flatly and said, ""I uh, wasn't invited"". I paused, and apologized and I felt mortified. I'm assuming she knew because she had seem the pictures on Facebook, but she said she had heard people around the office talking about it and she just never got invited.

I was not only extremely embarrassed for her, but I also took it very personally. I went right to my wife later that day and asked why she excluded this coworker. She then went to ""No, she was invited, she was busy blah blah"". I said I had just talked to Coworker who confirmed she wasn't invited. My wife then said, ""I couldn't do it. She's younger than all of us, I've seen you looking at her. I've seen how she looks at you"". I then just asked if my wife didn't invite her because she thinks I'm attracted to her and all she said was, ""I didn't say that"". I asked why she also had another coworker cover for her and say she couldn't make it and she asked why I was so concerned that she wasn't there. I told her how shitty it was to do that because of her own insecurity and we just haven't talked about it since. I genuinely do not have anything for this coworker, so my wife has nothing to worry about. I don't think anything we have done has ever given her that impression and all she could say was how we look at each other. There's so much nothing going on I don't even have the motivation to prove it to her because I know she won't believe it.

It's been a few days an I feel kind of disgusted and embarrassed when I look at my wife. When I see this coworker, I feel mortified, I can only imagine what it must have been like for her, but I'm also conflicted because I don't want to seem I care about her only because I found out she wasn't invited. I'm struggling most with my wife because I feel what she did was immature and petty and she's never treated anyone like this before. My wife hasn't brought it up, and it's affecting my productivity at work. It's only been a few days but I'm having trouble seeing my wife as anything but a mean girl not inviting everyone but the weird kid to her birthday party at school."
1fmjm2x,got a south korean girl pregnant during a hookup its mine,"So, in November of 2023, I posted on here that I traveled to South Korea with my friends and stayed there for a month. I met a Korean girl, hooked up with her, and two days before we left, she told me she was pregnant. Most of the comments told me I should go back and get a DNA test. I built up the courage, and on September 3, I booked a flight with my friend. We got there and texted her through Instagram, where she was keeping me updated with the baby, even though I was suspicious. Surprisingly, she wasn't upset with me; she was happy I was there. Anyways, I immediately asked for a DNA test, and it took three days to get the results. I was scared, nervous, and felt sick. Finally, the results came back - it's me, I'm the father. Not gonna lie, my heart dropped, I was sweating, shaking, and on the verge of tears. I came back home after being there for one week. I told her I needed to go home and think for a while. She said, and I quote, ""Ok, but please do what's right for our daughter."" It's been about two weeks since I've been back, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I still like her, but I live in America; it's not like I can just move there. I'm still so naive to so many things. Please give me some advice; I'm stressing.


Update : So, I've been getting a few DMs saying I fetishize Asians. Let me tell you how I even thought about going to South Korea. Around October of 2022, I decided to walk to a Korean restaurant that's four minutes away from my apartment and get some food. I enjoyed the food so much that I would go once or twice a week. Eventually, I grew close to the son, who was 20 at the time, and his mom. They're both Korean American. After being friends with him for a while, he asked if I wanted to take a trip to South Korea. For a while, I thought about it and eventually said yes. And that's how everything went down. I don't fetishize Asians. Korea was the first Asian country I've been to. I had only been to the UK and Mexico before. I'm talking with her, and we're figuring something out. I will let you guys know what will happen.

Update: I want to thank everyone who genuinely gave me advice. After talking with her, we both decided it's best if I go to Korea for a bit and be there for my daughter and build a relationship with her. She‚Äôs willing to get me Korean lessons and everything I need to make sure I am the best for my daughter. My family agrees I need to be there for her. I still need to figure out some things with my work, but that will come in time. Also, thank you to everyone who private messaged me. It really woke me up. Wish me luck, and check my page‚ÄîI posted a picture of me and her. I want y'all to see us. Thank y'all so, so much.üòä

ùêÆùê©ùêùùêöùê≠ùêû : I'm here in Korea living temporarily and doing my best to support my daughter and my girlfriend. I'm also learning Korean, thanks to the people who genuinely gave me advice. I'm happier more than ever. We plan on making a family Instagram soon, though I'm not sure when. If we do, I will let y'all know. "
166g3pm,How should I deal with my son after finding a horrifying video on his phone?,"Normally I don‚Äôt go on either of my kids‚Äô phones because I know how horrible that is, but my son was acting suspicious.  Like he had something he knew he shouldn‚Äôt on his phone and was desperately trying to hide his screen one day.

He‚Äôs only 14 but I‚Äôm honestly disgusted by what I saw on his phone.  He was at a friends party, and his friend lured another student to said party.  I say lured because of what they did to him.  My son was recording as his friend utterly pulverized the other student (single-handedly at that, my son didn‚Äôt help he just watched and laughed).  At one point the victim was forced to eat his own tooth that was knocked out by his assailant.  Like my sons friend was screaming in his ear to eat it.  After it was all over, the kid was lying on the ground, bleeding and crying and not even able to stand up.  

My son walks up to him and says ‚ÄúHa Ha!  You got the fuck kicked out of you ya fucking pussy.‚Äù  And then he high-fived his bully friend and said ‚Äúgood shit‚Äù.  That‚Äôs where the video ends.

I‚Äôm so disturbed by this because my other two children (both older than him) are great people and I‚Äôm commonly said to be a great mother.  He wasn‚Äôt raised this way.

I‚Äôm going to force my son to give the phone to the police and deal with all of his consequences.  Will this tear up the family, he‚Äôs very close to his father and I am afraid it will cause problems.  And I‚Äôd also like to think my son is a good person but I fear I‚Äôll never look at him the same way again.  Where to proceed?"
fvlyty,My son sent an ‚Äúintimate photo‚Äù to a classmate. She sent it to me. What now?,"My son is 19 and living on his own now. Apparently he was texting with some girl at his college and sent her an unwanted intimate photo. 

She tracked me down through and sent me it essentially saying ‚Äúyou should know what kind of man you raised.‚Äù

I‚Äôm mortified. I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I haven‚Äôt had to do nearly as much ‚Äúdirect‚Äù parenting since he moved out beyond helping him pick courses or make summer plans. 

I don‚Äôt know how to address this in a way that conveys the seriousness of it but is also empathetic enough that he listens to what I‚Äôm trying to tell him instead of shutting down. 

I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with this beyond awkward conversation with him. Any advice would be just stellar right now. Thanks."
g330qs,"My stepdaughter is 13 and pregnant, her mom kicked her out,what should we do?","My stepdaughter‚ÄùChloe‚Äù is 13 and told us she was pregnant.  She‚Äôs a bit of a, to put it nicely ,‚Äù a wild child‚Äù. Drinking, smoking. Whatever.  Her mother allowed Chloe‚Äôs 17 year old boyfriend to move in with them. (They live a few states away but Chloe visits on holidays and summers.)

Anyway Choles mother called a few days ago saying we have to  come and get her because she kicked Chloe out of the house. Weirdly the boyfriend is allowed to stay there.  

Chloe does not want the baby, neither do we so we have been looking into abortions. My husband said he will Chole a few weeks to decide what to do(abortion, keep, give up for adoption)

But as of now we have a pregnant teen in our house, she‚Äôs upset with her mother. Everyone is beyond stressed


::sorry about the rambling grammar I made the post without proof reading::

Thank you all for the advice

::Update because someone asked.  Chloe is doing well.  We were able to get her back into online school.  She is still pregnancy. She has to see a counselor 3 times before a termination is available.  She‚Äôs helping me with the younger ones and wants to get a new camera and take up

dylep3,I think I'm in danger," So I'm 16F and I'm usually alone at home by myself all day because both my parents work until very late at night  and I'm online school but lately I've been seeing this white van with tinted windows pull in my driveway and just sit there for 15 mins. I opened the door and moved my hands like ""is there something you need ""but they took off really quick... I didnt tell anyone except some friends but 1 day later and I hear a car outside ( since I'm in the country I hear everything) so I look and there it is again just sitting there. I got scared so I called my parents and they said it might be the delivery people but i dont think that's normal.  My parents told me to not call the cops unless it's an emergency but now when I'm outside walking my dog I see this van frequently pass my house all the time. It's making me very paranoid and scared, I have the picture of the van as well.
        
Update - I saw the van again earlier this morning.  I contacted my local towns sheriff's department and they contacted my parents, they want me to send a picture of the van and they will be on the lookout.My mom is mad because she said its probably a dumb delivery person and now the police are   gonna be in "" our family's business "" and my dad told me to start carrying his gun with me while outside. ( those were their reactions)"
9tcor7,My cat got tortured and needs surgery,"So, we have an indoor/outdoor car named Toothless. She in and out all day usually, and very vocal about what she wants to do when. Yesterday though, she was gone, which happens every so often, no big deal. This morning though, when I went to look for her, I found her with her front claws ripped out and bleeding, and her back leg twisted around completely. I rushed her to the vet, her foot is dead basically, and will probably require surgery to remove it, and they gave me an astronomically high quote for that, or else put her down to avoid prolonging her pain. What can I do?

EDIT: Vet told me its highly likely she was tortured, I don't have evidence as to who might have done it, but she's a black cat and last night was Halloween...idk Im assuming the worst here...

EDIT 2: Wow this blew up, thank you to everyone who has offered advice, regardless of what it is. Shes home right now, dead leg still attached, the vet cleaned as best she could from the maggots and right now we're looking for different quote for the surgery. Thank you to everyone who PM'd to offer help in any way, whether it was to spread awareness of it or to donate. Im honestly blown away. Thank you all so much. Thank you. Thank you."
g3urb4,How should I tell my parents that it‚Äôs not OK to have sex in the same room as me?,"
So me and my parents who are 36 and 35 went to a friend and ended up sleeping at their place yesterday. Their place is quite small so we had to share one guest room. They had one big bed and I had the couch. 

I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night. It was not because of them. I could immediatly hear heavy breathing and just kinda weird sounds. I opened my eye just a bit and yeah they were having sex under the blanket. I just pretended to be asleep but it was really uncomfortable .

I did end up falling asleep but it take time and I just wanted to tell them that I was awake but didn‚Äôt do anything. I feel like I should tell that that what they did wasn‚Äôt OK. How should I do that?"
iqcvqt,"I'm dating an older woman, but my family is not accepting at all. I need help.","I'm 23, she's 42. I met a wonderful woman a couple months back. We met at our public library. She'd come their quite often. I don't work there, but i go there at least once a week and know the place like the back of my hand. I'm a bookworm. Met my girlfriend there. We talked some and i asked her out. I just thought i met someone i had a real connection with, i didn't do it on age alone or anything. But it's great, honestly. She's way more mature then anyone i've dated before. We've been together for a couple months and it's probably the happiest i've been in a long time.

So, i brought her to dinner with my family, things were going ok at first. Aside from a joke someone made at her ""Oh, i didn't know your girlfriend needed to be chaperoned by her mom"" when she came in. But they asked her about her life, but then they started trying to fish for her actual age (Which i didn't mention. I just told her she was a woman). Asking who was president when she was born and stupid crap like that. I tried desperately to change the subject, but they kept making fun of her age. Then my little brother (17) asked what it was like to live through the great depression and they all made just other rude comments like that.

Then it went from jokes, to just being rude. Like telling her ""Careful, this one might steal your social security checks"" about me. Something else about me ""Picking up chicks at nursing homes"".

Eventually she just stormed off, she started crying and ran away. I chewed them all out.

My mom even asked me ""Why are you doing this? Is it because i didn't give you enough attention growing up?"" I asked what she meant, she told me that since i'm ""Dating a woman your mom's age, it's pretty obvious you're trying to seek motherly affection elsewhere."" Great, now she's implying i have some sort of fruedian complex.

How can i get my family to accept this relationship?"

Anything goes wrong I‚Äôll feel devastated. Please tell me, am I being cheap? Also I‚Äôm currently unemployed but received a job offer of 2000$ monthly.

hol6wc,My wife has gained a significant amount of weight and I am physically repulsed by her body.,"*EDIT*: I got a lot more replies than expected and I‚Äôve tried to read through as many as I can. I first want to thank everyone who gave their advice. While some of it did sting to read (the ones calling me a shallow asshole) honestly, it needed to be said. I really do regret the way I worded some things in this post and I admit it was immature of me to only talk about her looks and not her health. I promise I am deeply concerned about her health as well, I admittedly was not in the best mood when I wrote this, as I was feeling very frustrated.

After reading through some replies, I am definitely going to make sure at some point she sees a doctor. Reading a lot of these possible health conditions she might have scares me and I want to make sure we get that figured out as soon as possible.

The second thing is I take full responsibility I‚Äôm not doing my part with the healthy meals and exercise either. I would actually like to thank the comments mentioning that because it was something I did not even consider and needed to be made aware of. I am for sure going to take action and stop with the fast food because that is just as much my fault as it is hers. You guys are right, it is a team effort and I can‚Äôt expect her to eat healthy if I‚Äôm not willing to do the same. I also plan to step up and be more involved in the child care (watching the baby more so that she has time to exercise or just time for herself). It also helps that her mom is pretty involved too and I know she‚Äôd be more than happy to watch the baby for us too if we need it.

Third, I just want to clarify that I have never (and will never) called my wife fat, told her that‚Äôs she‚Äôs repulsive, etc. I would never actually SAY these things to her, I know better than that and I would never want to hurt her. I have never mocked or ridiculed her for her weight.

Fourth, to the people saying that I don‚Äôt really love her or that I‚Äôm being abusive, I am going to have to respectfully disagree with you there. I admit I sounded really shallow in my post and like a complete ass and could definitely have worded it better, but I‚Äôd like to make clear that I absolutely love and am in love with my wife. Her wonderful personality hasn‚Äôt changed since getting married and she has gone above and beyond as a mother. I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else to be the mother of my son. Aside from the weight issue, we honestly haven‚Äôt really had any other major problems in our marriage. We get along really well and enjoy each other‚Äôs company. I have no regrets marrying her, even with the weight gain. Of course I do hope she loses some weight but I‚Äôm in no way feeling regretful about getting married to her.

And this brings me to my last point- I‚Äôm not going to divorce her. I saw a couple comments saying my marriage is destined to fail but I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôm not going to just throw in the towel that easy and walk out on our marriage and on our son. As I said earlier, I still love her very much and I wanna be there for her in sickness and in health. Yes we are religious too and we have both talked about and agreed on the fact that we would never divorce unless it was something TRULY worth divorcing over (abuse, drugs, infidelity, etc). 

Again, thanks for the replies everyone and this has really led me to step back and consider my part in all of this too. I‚Äôm feeling more hopeful after reading these replies and think that I have some good starting points to go from here (seeing a doctor to make sure this isn‚Äôt a more serious issue for example being one of them). Thanks again everyone!

*ORIGINAL POST*:

22M here. My wife (also 22) and I both got married when we were 18. She used to be 125 pounds at 5‚Äô6. She was incredibly fit, had the most perfect body ever and even had abs. We had our beautiful son 2 years ago and she put on a ton of weight during her pregnancy. I know that obviously you‚Äôre supposed to put on weight when you‚Äôre pregnant but she put on way more than was normal. I thought maybe it would go away after the baby but it hasn‚Äôt. She just keeps gaining.

She is still 5‚Äô6 but now weighs 215 pounds. I know this sounds mean but she is HUGE. I don‚Äôt even recognize her anymore. I feel physically repulsed looking at her body and sex is awful now with her because I just can‚Äôt get turned on. I feel terrible even typing this out but it‚Äôs the truth. I haven‚Äôt really told her how I felt, but she knows she is big and has tried multiple times to lose weight. She always gives up after a couple weeks and goes back to her old ways.

The closest she ever got was losing 3 pounds. Not joking. Then she gave up and gained it back plus more. I still love her deeply, she is my wife and I love our family. But I can‚Äôt keep feeling like this in our marriage. How do I approach the topic of her weight with her without hurting her feelings? 

And by the way, I‚Äôm not even considering a divorce. That isn‚Äôt and will never be an option for me. But I really do want her to lose weight otherwise I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do."
fc4nv7,I think my mom and brother are having sex,"I‚Äôm sort of at a loss with this. To start off, I‚Äôm 25 and my brother is 20. Our dad passed away a year ago and my brother had a really hard time with it. He eventually withdrew from college and moved back home to get his head straightened out. I was home visiting this weekend and everything seemed normal. We hung out, went out to lunch, my brother and I saw a movie together, we caught up, the usual family stuff. My mom converted my old bedroom into a home office, so I was sleeping in the guest room in the basement.

Last night, after everyone went to bed, I snuck out back and blazed up. Don‚Äôt judge me. I‚Äôm not a pothead, but it helps me to relax sometimes. I came inside, watched tv, and around midnight was stupidly hungry so I went to the kitchen to get a snack.

While I was in the kitchen, I thought I heard someone yell something upstairs but it was muffled. I went to the base of the stairs and listened and I heard was I‚Äôm positive were sex noises from upstairs. I didn‚Äôt think my mom or bro was seeing anyone and I definitely didn‚Äôt thin anyone came to the house after I went downstairs. I was mostly just curious so I crept up the stairs a little and I could hear one of the voices was my mom for sure. I assumed it was just a booty call and maybe someone snuck in while I was downstairs. I went back to the kitchen, warmed up some pizza in the toaster oven and was eating it at the counter when I heard a door open and close upstairs, followed by footsteps, and then another door closing. Again, curious, so I went upstairs and went to my bro‚Äôs room to see if he was awake and knew what was going on. His light was on so I knocked lightly and he answered the door in boxers and looking sweaty. He sort of jumped when he saw it was me, like he wasn‚Äôt expecting it. He asked what‚Äôs up and I said I thought I heard some noises up here and wondered if he had too. He got super sketchy and blushed and said he hadn‚Äôt heard anything. I was super suspicious now and also felt super awkward bc it sorta seemed like maybe he had been involved in making those noises. I felt really embarrassed and weird and I basically gtfo of there and went downstairs.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night and today at breakfast things were way awkward with me and him and mom. Maybe I‚Äôm being paranoid, I was smoking last night, but it feels like maybe they‚Äôre having sex and I caught them. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm crazy and there‚Äôs another explanation or if I should say something. Part of me thinks if they are doing it they‚Äôre both adults, but idk, it‚Äôs got a major squick factor to it and I‚Äôm sorta at a loss. Do folks think I‚Äôm just being paranoid and, if not, should I say something?

Edit: I should have mentioned that I‚Äôm a female. Dunno that it makes a huge difference but Some people assumed I was a guy.

[UPDATE]


Still figuring out what comes next, but I got so much advice and so many responses last time I wanted to update you all. Last night, I pretended that I was going out for dinner and drinks with friends and said I wouldn‚Äôt be home until late. I drove around the block, parked, and snuck back into the basement. And then I waited and listened.

I heard the tv on and my mom and bro talking. I couldn‚Äôt really make out what they were saying. Around 9 o‚Äôclock they went upstairs. Once I was sure they were both upstairs I snuck up and listened at the base of the stairs (around the corner from the bottom so no one would see me). I felt like a nut but I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about all the what ifs. I heard voices from my mom‚Äôs room; again too soft to make out. After maybe 20 mins I heard a moan. I crept up the stairs and when I was at the top I could hear what were distinctly sex noises from moms room.

I crept down the hall to see if my bro was in his room, pushed the door open, and stuck my head in. At this point, I didn‚Äôt care if he asked me what I was doing home, I figured if he was in there I‚Äôd just tell him I came home early and wanted to hang out or something. But it didn‚Äôt really matter. It was empty.

I went back down the hall and listened at mom‚Äôs door. It was mostly quiet, the sound of the bed, a few grunts, but I distinctly heard mom saying oh fuck a few times. After a few minutes they clearly had climaxed, somewhat loudly, and the noises stopped and I heard my brother‚Äôs voice. He said he was going to take a quick shower. Then mom said she‚Äôd join him.

I was and am in a daze. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any doubt that they are having sex. I went back to the basement and I‚Äôve been lying here thinking for the last few hours. I haven‚Äôt said anything to either of them. Part of me wants to burst in on them, part of me wants to confront my bro, I don‚Äôt really want to talk to my mom.

It‚Äôs a really weird position to be in. I‚Äôm still sorting through all the thoughts I have. It‚Äôs a lot of different feelings all at once. It‚Äôs hard to explain."
15lixy7,I think my girlfriend has been drugging me,"I‚Äôve been debating posting this for along long time because I realize I sound fucking schizo. But here we go. 

We‚Äôve been dating since I was in freshman year of highschool, now I‚Äôm 26 and she‚Äôs 31, and we‚Äôve been living together for almost two years now. 

Our relationship is alright. We get into some fights but never big ones and never have screaming matches or anything like that. The worst one we had was when I was eighteen (so quite a long time ago). She burned all my sketchbooks and journals then, and sometimes when she‚Äôs mad at me now she‚Äôll rip up my stuffed animals. I know, I‚Äôm too old for them, but they bring me comfort. Sometimes she hits me, but it‚Äôs always just a slap or a punch in the chest. Either way, besides all of that were good. I love her. 

A few months ago, we were drinking and watching one of my favorite movies together, and she took my glass to refill our cups. She was out of sight for three minutes max. I finished my glass and started feeling tired. Like way more than I should have. I don‚Äôt really remember what happened next, but when I woke up the next morning I was sore and she told me I had blacked out the night before. I though that maybe I just drank too much, but I only had two glasses of wine and I can usually hold my liquor well. 

A week ago it happened again. This time, while we were eating dinner. It happened so quick that time, and when I woke up I was violently sick for the next couple hours. 

One more time yesterday. This time it was after a pretty big fight‚Äî she threatened to destroy one of my stuffed animals my mom had gotten me before passing away, and ended up ripping one of his ears off. We did end up yelling at each other this time, but I didn‚Äôt want to fight with her so I just apologised and we went back to normal. She got me some water. I remember how she was watching me when I drank it‚Äî like she hated me. It was so much hatred I wanted to cry, I‚Äôve never been looked at like that. 

I know I fell. I have a bruise forming on my forehead now, and my whole body hurts, and I‚Äôm so nauseous I‚Äôm in the bathroom to stay. 

I don‚Äôt want to sound crazy. I don‚Äôt want to think she could be doing something like that, but idk. I‚Äôm scared of her and I‚Äôve never been before.

Edit: thank you all for the advice. I‚Äôll go over everything and figure out what I‚Äôm going to do. üíõ"
1lib2n8,"My parents find my girlfriend unattractive, and now its starting to affect the way i look at her too.","I never once found her unattractive, but now, after hearing it constantly for the last 9/10 days, its starting to seep into my psyche and now Im seeing all the imperfections she has.

I fucking hate this feeling and I hate what theyve done to me.

On the surface its so easy to see that its their opinion and that I can always just.... not think like that.¬†

shbrvz,GP criticised my pubic hair then patted me like a child,"I went to a GP about an intimate issue today. I was incredibly nervous and even expressed this to her upon arriving. During the physical examination, the first thing she did was complain about my pubic hair and tell me I should have trimmed it before the appointment. I was under the impression that this is not a medical practitioner's business, something which shouldn't concern them, and certainly something which shouldn't be commented on. Then before I left the office she patted me on the cheek in an overly-familiar, condescending way like a grandmother or great aunt might do to a child.

It didn't feel like a professional encounter at all and I left feeling shamed for my body which I'm already overly self-conscious of, and without my questions being answered so I've now got to either ignore the problem or pluck up the courage to see someone else about it. I'm still hurt. What should I do?"
11jx4dw,I‚Äôm starving and my mom won‚Äôt feed me. Is there anything I can do?,"I‚Äôm 16 years old and I live with my Mom, her ex, and my sister.

2 1/2 - 3 months ago, my mom stopped going grocery shopping, and only on some days would her ex go out and buy ingredients to cook with. Meaning that I go most days with no food at all, with my only form of sustenance being my school lunches. On weekends, I‚Äôm shit out of luck. Originally, I thought it has to do with a bad financial situation, until she told me outright that she was simply too lazy.

I tell her that I‚Äôm hungry, and she replies to me saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always hungry.‚Äù I‚Äôm rapidly losing weight. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10-5‚Äô11 and I used to be 170 lbs, I‚Äôm down to 150 now. I‚Äôve never felt more weak in my entire life, and recently, I‚Äôve started feeling dizzy and lightheaded, some times even short of breath. How get through to my mom?"

odpq2c,Had a threesome with my boyfriend and his twin. I think they‚Äôre in love and I‚Äôm freaked out.,"This is weird, I know. It‚Äôs even weirder to post this, but I‚Äôm just very confused right now and I feel kinda dumb. 

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about a year, and I‚Äôm usually the type of girl that‚Äôs up for anything. Our sex life is amazing, and we have a good communication in general. We go to the same university, we live about 10 mins from each other and in other words, things are good. His twin brother was always in the picture, and I knew they were really close even before we started dating. But I thought that was just normal, honestly it might be maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it. I honestly don‚Äôt know. 

Yesterday we were in bed and out of nowhere he asks me what I think about threesomes, and whether I‚Äô be okay to have one with his brother. After a lot of convincing, I agreed. And fine, you can judge all you want, but I just thought I‚Äôd try it, and the way he described it made it seem less crazy than it sounds as I‚Äôm writing it now. 

Anyways long story short, the actual threesome was okay at first. I was uncomfortable but my boyfriend initiated and it was fine. Not to get into too much detail, but there were a few red flags that kept coming up which I can‚Äôt stop thinking about. For starters, they kissed each other, a lot, among other things I can‚Äôt really get into here. But it was just off. 

Now I know how this sounds, I know I shouldn‚Äôt have agreed from the start, but I did. And as a result, I can‚Äôt look at him the same way. It feels like he was trying to tell me he‚Äôs in love with his brother or something. It‚Äôs just really confusing and I have no idea how to open the subject up. Like is it even my place? 

Sorry in advance for this weird ass freaking post, but I needed to share."
t7jchk,My village thinks I'm a reincarnation of a goddess.,"This sounds so fucking crazy. But basically my little tiny village from india (my dad's village we live in the city now) rarely has female kids. They either have passed away as new borns or ran away at a young age. Everyone believes that this because the place is cursed. I'm the only girl who crossed the age of 10 and still visits(I'm 22 now) the place is riddled with tradition and customs that make me uncomfortable. 

Example-Putting money in my shirt and then touch me and saying that they are praying. 

They think I'm a reincarnation of a goddess here to save the village. I fucking hate the place I would rather kms than go back. But, I don't wanna hurt my dads feelings. How do I explain this to him without seeming like I'm ungrateful or here to 'curse' the village again?

The village consist of about 35 people."
1iuyniw,My colleague said something so fu***d up and I dont know what to do.,"Some context, I am 26 years old and I work as a Sofware Developer at this company for 4 years. I have a team lead who is also the owner of the company with whom I have worked with since I started. He is a normal guy, 37 years old with wife and two little kids. We talk and work together every day at the office. Today he said something so fucked up and I just avoided him the whole day and I dont know how I will go back to work on Monday.

We were having a smoke outside of the building at lunch break and he said out of nowhere - 
‚ÄúI wanna slice my wife in pieces and eat her, and after I am done with her I wanna rape both of the kids before I kill them, I have a demon inside me.‚Äù, that sentence came out of nowhere. We were talking about something non-related to work, he said that out of fucking nowhere and went back to the previous conversation like nothing happened. He never said anything like that before, not even close, nothing as fucked up as this, in fact I never even heard him joke before. It was like something else possessed him and made him say that. I dont know what to do. Do I report him to the police? Do I call his wife? Do I quit? Im at loss for words.

1kzsuq8,How do I get out of going to a strip club?,"I‚Äôm (28m) in Vegas for my friends bachelors party and they are planning to go to a strip club tomorrow night. My wife has asked that I don‚Äôt go and frankly I really have no desire to go either but the peer pressure is hard. 

I told them I don‚Äôt want to go and the guys have given me a hard time collectively saying that they promise they won‚Äôt tell or that I can just sit around in the club while they get lap dances. 

I think I‚Äôm going to just hang back when they all go tomorrow night but I want to do it in a way that doesn‚Äôt make me the center of attention. Any advice to help me figure this out would be helpful, thank you! "
153y0qm,"Ex-fianc√©e wants to catch up after he left me at the altar, how do I proceed?","Well exactly what the title states, also I‚Äôm writing this on mobile sorry for any formatting issues. 

My (28f) ex-fianc√©e ‚ÄúDerek‚Äù (32m) disappeared the morning of our wedding 2 years ago, evading all attempts to reach him from myself and his family. It was devastating, absolutely soul crushing, the event turned into a party to distract from the pain of the unknown, afterwards I returned to our apartment and slept on the bathroom floor in my wedding dress. It was quite the ugly sight to be honest. His mother ended up coming to the apartment when she informed me tearfully that Derek had run off with an ex of his, they had apparently reconnected a week prior to wedding and he just couldn‚Äôt go through with it opting instead to rekindle his relationship with his ex. His family was horrified, I didn‚Äôt hear from him until 3 months after he left. He called me, apologised and then revealed that his ex had been hiding his child from him that he just found out about, he wanted to be with them. That‚Äôs pretty much all that was said, I didn‚Äôt say much, actually I think I only said ‚Äúhello‚Äù. The whole situation left me numb, I just didn‚Äôt care anymore. Thankfully though my friends were and continue to be there for me, through all of this muck, they encouraged me to seek therapy and work on healing. Which I‚Äôll be honest was terribly difficult, but after year I felt myself again.

Which brings me to today, after the this whole debacle and subsequent self improvement/rebuilding I moved to the UK (originally from Australia) for a change in scenery. Last night I got a message request on instagram, it was Derek. ‚ÄúHey üëãüèª, I‚Äôve heard you moved to Wales, that‚Äôs so cool, I‚Äôm travelling to Cardiff towards of the end of July. I‚Äôm deeply sorry about everything and I want to discuss what happened leading up to the wedding. I hope Im not overwhelming you, let me know if you‚Äôd like to talk over lunch.‚Äù Firstly, no idea who told him about my move. Secondly, I don‚Äôt know if I crave closure from him, but I also don‚Äôt won‚Äôt to decide to decline to only layer on regret my decision. 

So I turn to you strangers of the internet, what should I think about before reaching a decision? Would be wise to decline or should I humour him and listen to his ‚Äúreasons‚Äù?

Okay minor update: Wow, this garnered far more attention than I anticipated, so bare with as I try to navigate all of your advice. Although the general consensus is quite clear. I have learned that an old mutual friend of ours revealed where I moved, and evidently he‚Äôs been stressing that he needs to tell me something. For the time being I have decided to simply ignore his message, and work through any emerging feelings with my therapist. Thanks

Update: Hi, so as I mentioned previously I decided to not respond to his message. A day after I received another message from him, which I won‚Äôt write out in its entirety, to sum it up he apologised for how disingenuous his previous message was and explained why he had reached out to me. Essentially he wanted to discuss that week, that final week before our wedding and why he left without discussing it. I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm gonna refrain from going into detail about our whole stories here, but I will say my ex-fianc√© (thank you for the correction btw) has been diagnosed with Avoidance PTSD from past experiences, I feel for him but I told him that I still couldn‚Äôt move past being left in a state of limbo for 3 months. Irregardless, ultimately I agreed to meet him, and I don‚Äôt regret it. He‚Äôs not with his ex, I‚Äôve found she‚Äôs actually since passed away, which is part of the reason that she reached out to me, and yes the child is his. The lunch was short and in the end he handled me an envelope, which contained all of the money we spent preparing for the wedding. It all honesty it was cathartic for me, I‚Äôve often feared that I‚Äôm still subconsciously harbouring feelings for him, but the lunch proved I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve closed that chapter of my life, with him, with the woman I was and now, now I‚Äôm free. Thank you all"
1jcwejp,How do I tell my husband that his mom is destroying my mental health?,"I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as possible. 
My husband (55M) and I (48F) have been together for 8 years. His mother has lived with him for 15 years (after her husband/his dad passed away). She is 82 and of sound mind. She‚Äôs never worked, never driven. 

About 2 years ago I resigned from my corporate job so that I could care for my aging parents. They both passed away about a year ago. I now work part time from home. 

My mental health took a turn for the worse when I left my job and got worse when my parents passed. I‚Äôve worked incredibly hard to feel better (lots of therapy, antidepressants, self care, etc.). 

I‚Äôve now realized that being home with my MIL contributes significantly to my ‚Äúbad days‚Äù. While she‚Äôs always lived with us since I‚Äôve been around, working 12 hour days previously made it easier to deal with her. 

From the time I wake up in the morning, she‚Äôs up my ass. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing today? Why are you leaving the house? When will you be home? Does (husband) know you‚Äôre leaving the house? What are you making for dinner? Can you make a doctors appointment for me?‚Äù
She won‚Äôt answer her own cell phone so as soon as her phone rings, she tracks me down to talk to whoever is on the other end, even if it‚Äôs just to confirm an appointment. Even if I‚Äôm in the middle of my own phone call or a meeting.

My husband and I travel frequently, however she refuses to be alone so we have to hire live-in care for her while we‚Äôre gone. 

I‚Äôm somewhat obsessed with cleanliness and it drives me crazy that she refuses to wash her hands after using the bathroom. She will only run her fingers under running water after touching raw meat, and then proceeds to touch everything else. She refuses to use the dishwasher and the dishes she washes have to be rewashed after I find them in the cabinet with food on them. 

I feel like I‚Äôm a prisoner in my own home. I can‚Äôt have a conversation with my husband without her making a comment. If I‚Äôm out of sight for more than 15 minutes, she will track me down to ask what I‚Äôm doing. She constantly makes comments on the things I do, the clothes I wear, how I clean. I have zero privacy because she randomly goes through my things. I leave sweet notes for my husband and she reads them and then tells me about it. If she sees us kiss, she makes a sexual comment that she finds hilarious. 

I‚Äôve tried setting boundaries-don‚Äôt go in my bedroom, don‚Äôt touch my things, don‚Äôt interrupt me during X hours, but she ignores all of it. 

My husband knows that she‚Äôs difficult to deal with but I‚Äôm not sure that he knows how difficult it is for me. I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do because I can literally feel my mood take a nose dive when I interact with her.

co7khe,Is it ok for men to cry when their dog gets put down?,"My dog (his name is chewy) is being taken to the vet by my dad as I‚Äôm typing this post. Chewy is ten years old and he watched me grow up since I was 4. He was a great dog. Every time I came home from a baseball game he would sit right in front of my bed while I changed out of my uniform and got ready for the shower. He would wait for me by my bed to finish my shower and when I got back to my bed he‚Äôd hop up and lay right next to me while I watched tv. He would wait for me at the gate when I came home every day from school. I have two more dogs that I love just as much as chewy, and I have had a dog and a cat die before, but the dog was only ours for a couple days and then it ran away and got hit by a car when I turned 8 so I really had no idea how to feel about it. (I loved her but I was little and I didn‚Äôt understand that she was gone) Now that chewy is being put down my heart is broken. I know I should‚Äôve went with my dad but he works and I wouldn‚Äôt have a ride home, and he didn‚Äôt want me to be there while my dog died. I can‚Äôt imagine being in a room as my dog is being put down, the look on his face unable to understand what is happening. I couldn‚Äôt imagine the mental scar that would leave me. I don‚Äôt know how to cope with it though and I dont like people seeing me crying because it makes me look vulnerable and I hate that. Please help.

yf5ui7,I just turned away a girl that didn't have a place to sleep,"I (21F) live alone, I'm in my last year of school. I was watching a movie, it is currently 1:41 am and I hear a knock on my door. I don't immediately open it because I'm freaking out (still am to be honest) because all my friends live quite far and they wouldn't come over without telling me first. I speak through the door and ask who is it. A girl's voice answers and I calm down. I politely ask her what she wants and her answer freaks me out even worse. She tells me that her roommate left the key to her house with a shop owner but the shop is closed and now, she doesn't have a place to sleep. I want to say yes but I blurt ""no, sorry"" because quite frankly, I don't feel comfortable with letting in a stranger. I have lived here for about two weeks and the only person I know is my neighbor. She tries to plead but I am adamant in my response and she says okay and walks away. I feel bad for her. My heart is still racing. Did I do the right thing in saying no?"
1l7couk,My boyfriends upset with my response to his daughter visiting,"Hey all, I just wanted to get some advice from parents in the community about my boyfriend‚Äôs daughter coming to stay for the month of July. I (24) have been dating my boyfriend (30 who we‚Äôll call b) for about a year now. He had his daughter when he was around 17 and after she was born his girlfriend at the time moved to be closer with family (about 18 hrs away). B gets his daughter every July, and this is where I have some reservations.  B was renting a house off of an older gentleman who retired and the new house B will be renting is not ready until August. So, since mid May, B has been staying with me in my studio apartment. He casually mentioned to me today that his daughter would be staying with us in my studio for July. I responded that it felt a little inappropriate especially since his sister lives 5 min away from us (2 bedroom apt) and his mom is 30 min away (4 bedroom house). I tried to explain to him that it‚Äôs not appropriate for his 12 yr old  daughter to not only be meeting me for the first time but to also be sleeping on an air mattress in the same room as us. I‚Äôm my opinion she‚Äôs at that age where she needs her privacy and she‚Äôs old enough to understand relationships and might not feel comfortable staying so close to us especially since I am a stranger to her. I asked him what his daughter‚Äôs mom thought and he said he never told her because she would be okay with it. If that was my daughter I don‚Äôt think I would let her visit her dad knowing this information. It‚Äôs a scary world out there and I just want what‚Äôs best for his child. 

So to any mothers and fathers out there, am crazy for thinking like this or would you too have reservations if your kids were in the same situation. 

Also if there are any suggestions as to how u can better handle this situation please let me know. 


****UPDATE****

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone and the advice I have been given. B and I did end up having a conversation last night which I will get into, but there are a few key points I did want to go over before I get into it. 

*** also, sorry if I don‚Äôt hit every key point or this is all over the place. I am at work and the comments started to get crazy so this update is a little rushed. 


1.) With the renting/living together issue. B has been renting the house he was at previously for about 6 years up until it was sold and he was looking at getting a long term hotel or Airbnb until the new house was ready (There are some repairs and updates that need to be done from the previous tenants in the new house). I brought up him living with me for the short period until he gets a place since our relationship has grown into us talking about our future together. He does pay half the rent and we both agreed that if it did not work out I would renew my lease and we would continue to live in separate places and work from there. As of right now all of his stuff is in a storage unit and he just has his clothes at my place. 

2.) With B only getting his daughter for a month. B and his daughter‚Äôs mom were both wild teens that ended up in the wrong crowd. His ex moved closer to family for help and to get away from the environment she was living in. They are both very active in each other lives, they are still good friends, and they do have regular calls to plan stuff for their daughter ( I am normally with him when he‚Äôs on the phone with her and I have gotten to talk to her on a few occasions). Again, they have been living 18 hrs away from each other for 12 yrs. Although it might not be an excuse for some people, it does make it harder to visit people especially when both grew up in poverty and became parents at such a young age. B‚Äôs ex has since remarried and they have a beautiful family together which makes me extremely happy for his daughter. B does still see his daughter throughout the year, this is just when she actually gets to stay with him.

3.) For people thinking that I will be babysitting the month she‚Äôs here. B has been able to take off work about 3 out of the 4 weeks she‚Äôs visiting. The week he will be at work she will get to spend with her grandma who has taken time off work as well. So I‚Äôm not too worried about that. 

4.) For people saying I‚Äôm being selfish not wanting him to see his daughter. I‚Äôm actually very excited to meet her. Almost every time B and I are together we are planning for his daughter‚Äôs visit. Places she might want to eat at, outdoor adventures to try, passes to a theme park near us, tickets to a soccer game, movies, events in our city, and much more. I absolutely love kids and do want to be involved in her life but I want it to be respectful and with what she is comfortable with. I grew up with a single father and understand how it feels to be introduced to someone who might be involved in everything you do for the rest of your life. 

5.) With her staying with us. I would like to think that he was just overly excited about us meeting and did not think twice about it. I appreciate a lot of the people for explaining the legal issues and expressing other concerns as well. B did not grow up in a stable household and most of the time shared a room with his siblings and family members. Although it is not an excuse, I do think that‚Äôs why he did not see a problem with her staying with us in my studio. And I will say that did cause me to really reflect on his maturity level as well as how he would act in the future if we had kids. 

So for the update

Last night we both sat down and I expressed how his reaction made me feel not thinking it was appropriate for his daughter to stay in my studio. It felt as if he was trying to say I did not want to see his daughter when I was just really trying to look out for all parties involved. He admitted that after our first conversation he realized that him being excited for us to meet caused him to be inconsiderate to both parties. I am the first significant other to meet his child and he felt like that one month out of the year would not be enough since I would more than likely only see her on the weekends. I expressed to him that me seeing her only on the weekend might be best for our first time meeting but it was ultimately his daughter‚Äôs decision. He admitted after our first conversation that he called his ex and she did express that she would rather him get an Airbnb, stay with his mom, or stay with his sister. B‚Äôs already booked an Airbnb and will be staying there when his daughter visits. So that‚Äôs pretty much it, I honestly thought there was going to be a much larger issue and wanted to make sure I got as many point of views as possible before we sat down and talked again. Again, I would like to thank everyone for their input. Especially since this was a situation I have truly never had to deal with before. "
1jsstg7,i am 17 and pregnant and i don‚Äôt know what to do.,"my boyfriend is 18 turning 19 soon, and i‚Äôm turning 18 later in the year. we have been together for almost 2 years and want to stay with each other. i missed my period in march and i had this gut feeling that i was pregnant, i took a test on friday and it came back positive. i took another one yesterday morning and it‚Äôs l positive. 
i‚Äôm having so many conflicting feelings, we want this baby but we also haven‚Äôt even begun to start our lives yet. i don‚Äôt have a job currently (i haven‚Äôt had a job before and you need expierience to work at mcdonald‚Äôsüòê), and my boyfriend works for his father and makes good money especially for right out of high school(20/hr). i know that isn‚Äôt enough to support a child i am not stupid, and i don‚Äôt come from money. i don‚Äôt want my child to suffer through being poor. i know that‚Äôs a big enough reason to just give up but i don‚Äôt know. i know the state of the world isn‚Äôt the greatest either. i don‚Äôt want to put it up for adoption because i am terrified of birth and i was adopted and obviously i didn‚Äôt turn out too great. i know when i talk to my grandma (who i live with currently) she is going to tell me to abort it and it is a thought in my mind considering everything in my life is against this pregnancy. i live in a blue state so thankfully i have the option to do so but it just doesn‚Äôt feel right. i have always been pro choice and ever since this happened i have really been upset at those who think differently because i don‚Äôt want to do it. i want this baby but i don‚Äôt have the income i don‚Äôt know how i would handle college with a child.

i just really need advice on my situation, preferably from a woman who has gone through something similar

and before you comment i don‚Äôt wanna hear how abortion is wrong(give me the money to pay for my baby then) and i don‚Äôt wanna hear how i got myself into this situation & i‚Äôm a whore(no fucking shit) 

EDIT: thank you for all the nice advice!! i love hearing from these older people who still call me honey lol i feel so old even though i‚Äôm not and like everything is going so fast. this transition period in my life is so difficult. hearing people‚Äôs situations really put a lot into perspective and i‚Äôm really appreciative to those comfortable enough to share. i have to talk to my grandma soon but i think i know my decision. this shit is so difficult to deal with while i‚Äôm a couple months away from graduating.

p5z7n3,How do I react to hearing my son having sex?,"I (35F) and my husband (38M) were getting ready to sleep last night, my son (13M) had a friend over (13M) and they were here for a sleepover, fine whatever. But as we were about to sleep after \\\~30 minutes of just reading and getting ready to sleep, we started to hear obvious humping noises, bed creeks and even some muffled moans. I am not against homosexuality, and am very defendant of LGBTQ+ rights. It is not about who he is being with, but his age, and honestly me not being mentally prepared.

&#x200B;

He always has been that innocent, silent kid who was pretty pure. I just... was not ready? And definitely not ready to hear these noises tonight. I don't want to freak him out or scare him, but I am getting the breakfast ready soon and I don't know how to look at his or his friends face without the shock in my face. Any advices? Do I talk about it with my son? Should I let him know to be more careful maybe? I don't know.. I just don't want to imagine or hear these voices again, it felt like hearing your parents having sex when you are a kid, but ten times worse, what do I do? My husband says to just let them be but I don't know if I can handle another night of *\*this\**"
1ed1amu,My wife said something that terrifies me. ,"My wife said something that terrifies me.

For backstory and context, when my wife and I first got together, she admitted she had no desire to have children due to 2 previous miscarriages in her last marriage. 4 years and a wedding later she came to me with the desire to be a mom. A few months later and she was pregnant. He was a happy healthy boy and everything seemed great at first. I slotted right into being a dad and he's my little ray of sunshine. 

My wife developed terrible PPD exacerbated by pumping anxiety. During a few arguments caused by her being overstimulated, she's admitted to me that she feels no emotional attachment to him and that he's just a child living in our home. She's been going to therapy and things seemed like they were getting better. Don't get me wrong, she's an amazing mother, always makes sure he's well cared for and has everything he needs or wants. But it's obvious she doesn't feel connected to him. Today, after a few particularly stressful days where he's been very needy and crying constantly (due to teething) she texted me while I was at work. It read ""He's pushing me to the edge. This morning I just wanted to put him in a hot car and walk away. I'm ripping my hair out and I'm in the middle of a mental breakdown, I just can't do the crying anymore."" I immediately made sure he was safe with my mom and arranged for her to watch him overnight. I talked with her more and it seems like this is just an out of the blue manic episode. I'm just terrified of what happens if she has another and she acts on those feelings. I don't know what to do here and it's killing me inside. "
1jvnn26,Do I tell his wife,"Posting from a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I recently met a man in the wild and we hit it off. Seemed great and genuine and showed a lot of interest in getting to know me. We exchanged contact information. We met up one night for a  drink and he expressed his romantic interest in me and we just had a fun conversation. We ended up kissing when we said goodbye for the night and that was the last I saw him. He was saved as a contact on my phone and today he popped up on my social media as someone I may know. That was when I discovered he has a whole wife and two kids under 5 . I‚Äôm very upset because I did not sign up to play a part in someone else‚Äôs lies. 

I need advice here. I‚Äôm obviously never going to see this man again but I‚Äôm conflicted on my moral obligation when it comes to his wife. I don‚Äôt want to make a family fall apart but I also think his wife deserves honesty. I also don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre in an open marriage or if they‚Äôre perhaps separated. It‚Äôs a lot of unknowns. 

-If you were the wife, would you want to know? 
-Do I tell him I know about his wife and kids? 
-Do I just block him and move on? 
 
Please help. I have so much anxiety over this and just want to be able to move on. "
mmtiav,Is My Cat Getting Molested??,"So my gf adopted this young outdoor cat who was always hanging on our porch a couple months ago. The cat is maybe a year old now and had been hanging out in this area since he was a kitten. When she went to get his shots done and a check up from the vet, the doc informed her that he had butthole damage. He had some sort of scarring on his butthole and we joked that he was a rape victim, but assumed it was most likely from doing something stupid outside or getting into a fight with another animal. He hangs out mostly inside but when he does go out he will sometimes come back with a red and inflamed butthole. We continued to brush it off. 

Two days ago he was outside and we saw him walking around the side of our house. My gf, roommate, and I were watching him through the window when our old creepy nextdoor neighbor came out and started calling the cat over to him. The cat came up to him and he started to pet the cat a little bit then proceeded to pick him up and walk around behind a bush out of our sight. He was taller than the bush and had crouched down so we couldn‚Äôt see either of them at all behind it. Maybe 2 min later the old man emerges and cat out of sight. Old man glances at us and walks inside. Our cat comes back about an hour later and you wouldn‚Äôt believe it but his butthole was bright red and inflamed... That obviously looks suspect as hell right?? We haven‚Äôt let him outside since that as we are worried about his well being. And there really isn‚Äôt anything we could do about even if we knew he was being molested by our neighbor. Any advice on what we should do and if you think he is getting molested? Any cat butthole experts know what else it could be?
We are all kinda worried and got a bit of sick feeling in our stomachs from the whole thing..

Is the old man molesting him or are we overreacting?

Also side note- this cat does not have a single care in the world, u could step on him and he‚Äôll just lay there and accept it. If any cat were to be a rape victim cat it would be this one.

Edit: any jokes i have made are not to be taken seriously. just tryna make a scary situation a little more easy to handle/process. We are contacting the vet now."
xaxwly,I 24m called off our wedding because my fiance told my 12 year old baby sister that she is not our real family.,"Jess 23f and I have been together for two years and she never liked my mom and with good reason because my mom is an alcoholic. My sister was placed into my care not too long ago. If I had not taken her, she would have been placed in the system. Jess never liked the idea and if I did not know any better, I would say that she was disappointed when I made the decision.

She wants us to have a baby and has been very vocal about it especially since my sister moved in. I am not particularly ready because I have a lot of responsibilities so it does not seem possible at the moment. I am juggling work and college on top of taking care of my sister. Jess still does not seem to understand that but I brushed it off as normal relationship differences.

Last night I worked night shift and this morning, my sister was not herself at all. I took her out for ice cream and  tried getting her to talk and she eventually tearfully told me that she knows that I don't want her here. I asked her what gave her that idea and she explained to me that my fiance was telling her that we will soon have a baby of our own and start our own real family because that is what adults do. 

There wouldn't be enough space for her because her room is supposed to be the baby's nursery so she might have to be taken back to my mom. I was so livid for many reasons but I tried not to show my sister. My mom was a functioning  alcoholic but got worse a while after I left home. Maybe because I took care of everything and everyone so now she had to be an actual parent. Anyway she would leave my sister alone for a day or two to go see her boyfriend. My sister would eventually have to call me and tell me the truth once the food ran out so I would have to drop everything and go down there. She generally tried to hide my mom's bad parenting.

She told  me the day I took her was the happiest day of her life and I have a very pink thank you bracelet to prove it. So it made me very mad to hear that Jess told her that she would go back. I explained to her that I want her here and nothing would ever change that. She has nothing to worry about and that Jess did not mean anything she said. She is not usually mean so it's so confusing for me.

My sister normally worships the ground Jess walks on but has been avoiding her today. I asked Jess about it and she did not deny. She said that my sister is not our responsibility and that she is ruining our plans to start a real family. I told her that my sister is in fact my responsibility and real family. I have no intentions of having a baby with her or get married if she can't respect that.

She freaked out and started shouting and calling my sister names saying it's all her fault. My sister must have heard because it's a tiny apartment. Because of this, I told her that she needs to leave my place and go calm down. We were planning on eloping but it's definitely off the books now.

Did I make the right decision? And how do I reassure my sister especially after she heard what Jess said about her?"
15v2w8e,A guy pushed me off the bed for calling him beautiful.,"It was a first date. We had done physical things and I was filled with emotions. I told him ""You're so beautiful"" and he pushed me off the bed. I fell to the floor and bashed my head. 

He said ""Don't call me that.""

I got dressed and left. I'm very confused. I'm new to America from Ukraine so I don't understand his reaction to that word. Did I say something wrong? Should I tell someone what happened?"
tffupf,I (31M) cheated on my girlfriend (45F) and I have no idea what to do,"I went to a party with a mutual friend and indulged in too many ""substances"". My friend had been pressuring me all night to sleep with this girl and she was all over me. I kept saying no and that I had never cheated before and it wasn't who I am as a person. My friend ends up hooking up with another girl and by this point I am beyond drunk and high. Anyway, I go to bed and I'm half asleep when this girl is unbuttoning my jeans and starts riding me and kissing me. By this point I just give up and lie there until she's done. We used a condom and I didn't cum. My memory for that night is pretty patchy and I woke up with several severe bruises that I can't account for. I've been crying for days about it, my girlfriend is working abroad and has been for a few weeks. I really don't want to lose her and part of me doesn't want to tell her what happened. I would never have normally let anything like this happen and I know for sure that I will never do anything like it again so I think that maybe telling her would be pointless and just make everything worse. I wish there was a way I could compartmentalise it and feel a bit better but at the moment I feel like an entirely different person to who I was before and I don't know what to do."

opfqlb,How do you professionally say I don't give a fuck,
neflrc,My (F22) boyfriend (M24) has gone through some sort of personality change and no one seems to acknowledge it.,"
I understand how bizarre this situation sounds, but I honestly have no idea where else to go, at this point.

Some background: 
I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for around 4 years. He is sweet and kind and extremely empathetic. Our families like each-other, and we had plans to get married before the pandemic. Just before march we decided to go on holiday abroad. Another couple joined us later. ( John= husband, Kelly =Wife) It was lovely and we spent most of the time hiking or swimming in the lake. I speak the local language so i did most of the talking. All 4 of us are complete urban legend and dark tourism enthusiasts, so we went into the city for a tour. I spent most of the time translating because the translator there was only half doing her job. The urban legends weren‚Äôt really anything special, it was things we‚Äôve already read about so we decided to split from the group. Kelly and I saw a salon still open so we went to go check it out, whilst John and my boyfriend went to check out some old church and ruins (John‚Äôs an archaeologist). 
After our nails had dried, kelly called John to see whats up, because she had something like 10 missed calls from him. We had our phones on silent. John was panicking and basically speaking gibberish. Kelly told him to slow down and finally managed to get that my boyfriend had fallen and now he‚Äôs lost. We basically ran out of the salon and ran over to the church. John was in a panic and had called the local police of OUR hone country, instead of the country here, so i immediately dialled the local number and they told us that they‚Äôd already been contacted and they were on their way. They then instructed us to remain where we were together. John was with Kelly in the woods, so i called them back, but it was pitch black and i fell apparently exactly where my boyfriend had fallen. I bashed my head against something, presumably a rock and im fairly sure I had a mild concussion since i was pretty disoriented from there on. The emergency services found my bf completely fine. Uninjured. A bit confused but thats it. We got driven back and John calmed down, but he was still more shaken than my boyfriend. We said goodnight to them and decided to take it easy the next day. My boyfriend slept for over 24 hours, and i got seriously concerned and checked a few times to make sure he was still alive. I briefly woke him up and made him drink water. He went straight back to sleep and woke up later. 

Main: 

I noticed something off immediately. As soon as he woke up his entire personality was just off. Like down to the tiniest things. His pattern of speech, his eye movements, his posture. I asked him repeatedly if he‚Äôs feeling better. We went out for lunch and he called me Jarissa. This is not my name. John and Kelly cracked up and teased him. We never knew anyone called Jarissa. Im sure that it wasnt another women and he isnt cheating. I‚Äôm completely sure of that. He also ordered a meal with tuna. I didnt say anything, but John made a remark saying he must be trying new things or something like that. My boyfriend absolutely despises tuna. It was small things like that, in addition to being much colder and quieter than usual. He is usually very outgoing and warm. On the plane back, we were snuggled up and he asked me to tell him ‚Äústories‚Äù. So i did, but he interrupted me and said ‚Äúno stories about us‚Äù. So i did. And his response was off, as if he was hearing new information for the first time but pretending to have known all along. And then i told a fake story about skiing (he cant ski) with his family and he was nodding along. I made the decision to get him checked out for memory loss or something as soon as we were back. I was sleeping in the car ride home, and woke up briefly to him having taken us somewhere completely different instead of home. So i raised my concerns right there and then and told him he needs to get checked out. He stated that this was our home, and pointed to a house. He took the keys and walked up to the house and of course it didnt work. I demanded to drive back this time. The ride was extremely awkward. He couldnt open his phone,  because he had forgotten the passcode (thank god for face ID). I got a text and asked him to check it and he said ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù. This is what we normally do. We dont usually ask, we just check it for eachother. 

He also slept an extremely long time too. I went to the GP (General Practitioner. Sort of a family doctor) with him and told him point blank he needed to get checked out. I explained the situation to the doctor and he did a basic check up. We got a call the next day and the GP assured me that everything was completely OK. His cognition was apparently completely fine, no sign of long term or short term memory loss, which i argued against vehemently, seeing as he couldnt even remember his fucking passcode. The GP said that it was entirely possible he had some stress from the flight, since he has a mild fear of flying. I asked for a second opinion and evaluation, and the second GO also said theres no sign of head injury or anything and advised against seeing a neurologist without him. I called his mother to see if we could stay over for a while and his mother was happy to have us. She noticed a few changes in his personality but didnt really say anything much, just assumed that he was trying new things. His previous aversion to tuna had completely changed. I spoke to her in private and i mentioned other things too such as the fact he sleeps for incredibly long hours now, upwards of 9 hours, and how ive caught him staring at me sleeping and rifling through my journal, in which i keep pictures and notes of significant events for me. I also mentioned his coldness, and how his style of fucking has also completely changed and his smile is different. And then i started crying. Seriously i have no idea what to do. No one believes that something is wrong, but there is something so wrong with him. Its like his whole personality has shifted to the left. I entertained the possibility that it was a concussion which had caused me to assume that it was his fault, when in reality it was i who had made changes , but i have physical evidence and also evidence from his family that he has changed.

In videos his voice has changed, too. He way he speaks has changed. Literally any help is appreciated, thanks.

Edit: edited for general comprehension. Also, i didnt contact a neurologist because the GP had advised not to. He also refuses to go since the GP said everything is fine. This is over a year ago and the changes are still there. Its settled down a lot but he is no longer as outgoing or warm and does some thing where he stares at certain objects or people for too long and then looks in my general direction and back, robotically. He also talks in the third person occasionally and its seriously unnerving. For a while we slept in separate rooms because i was so creeped out by his behaviour change. Its like hes barely even human sometimes, i seriously have no other way to describe it. Like some lizard person or something, and it creeps the hell out of me. He speaks in his sleep, too and its not in english or any other language i know. But it isnt complete gibberish because there is a flow to it. This has continued on and was part of the reason i wanted to sleep separately for a while.

I‚Äôll definitely be going to a neurologist myself tomorrow and explaining it, but there is little else i can do if he refuses to come along. 
(Sub edit: my boyfriend shuts down conversation everytime when i ask him what happened. He nearly opened up one time and started with ‚Äúthere was a goat‚Äù and then stopped and refused to say anything else. Its so bizarre. How does a goat relate to this??)

Edit 2: some of you seem to think im writing a horror story, so im making it abundantly clear right now: neither of us are religious or believe in ghosts, spirits or entities. I‚Äôm not stupid enough to do more than entertain that idea briefly. I am going to a neurologist tomorrow and going down the logical route rather than the ‚Äúpossessed by a demon‚Äù route.

**Edit 3**
I saw the doctor today on short notice, so the time slot was pretty small. My boyfriends mother agreed to go, as someone suggested bringing her along, and i showed her this post. I did most of the talking and the doctor seemed concerned. He said he will reference me to a neurologist but i need my boyfriend to come with me. Thats going to be the difficult part. If a doctor is expressing concern then i‚Äôm genuinely incredibly worried over the health of my boyfriend now. I was before, but now it seems serious, and i wasnt aware of the severity til yesterday. I have til 8pm tomorrow to get him to come, so any suggestions on exactly HOW to would be great.

#Also, addressing the people calling this fake and paranormal; just write off all possibility of ghosts, right now. 

I dont believe in any of that. A goat is entirely possible because there were goats that lived in this area, but i seriously have no idea how that could link to him getting lost or why he stops talking there. He could have followed a goat and got himself lost? It doesn‚Äôt mean its paranormal, and i refuse to consider that seeing as there are a vast number of logical explanations.

Also, people telling me to break up with him: no.

#Edit 4

I convinced him to come to see a neurologist who specialises in brain injuries. Long story short; nothing. They scanned him, brought him in for psychological evaluation too. They tried telling me that perhaps there was something wrong with me, until i used video evidence. Today they did some blood work on him, since i mentioned swimming in lakes, and we‚Äôre expecting results maybe in a week or so. He‚Äôs going back tomorrow to see a psychiatrist, since there isnt anything obviously wrong in terms of injury to his brain. 

He was sulky with me for a while, but we‚Äôve just rescued a litter of kittens so that requires us to talk to one another. I cant say things are looking up, but at least things are going somewhere."
mtc9p2,Fianc√© shaved his balls before bachelor party?,"Should I be concerned that my fianc√© NEVER shaves his junk and before his bachelor party does???  I don‚Äôt trust this at all now...the bachelor party is in Vegas




Update:
Thanks for you responses, everyone.  I genuinely wasn‚Äôt expecting so many replies but I‚Äôm grateful for those who took the time to be kind.  I seldom post on Reddit so I actually didn‚Äôt know you folks could read previous posts.  But with that being said, I‚Äôm glad a majority of you pointed it out because there‚Äôs a pattern here....and that pattern isn‚Äôt actually him.  Yes, he can be the absolute worst person I‚Äôve ever met.  There are clearly great qualities about him (which is why I‚Äôve stayed) and my friends and family who have met him tell me what a great guy he is all the time.  So thank goodness this is anonymous.  The pattern I‚Äôm mentioning is how I‚Äôm feeling in this relationship and it‚Äôs not good.  He may not cheat on me in Vegas.  But either way, I don‚Äôt trust him and I don‚Äôt feel safe talking to him about it and for that reason, I can‚Äôt marry him.  I just can‚Äôt.  Again, thanks for you responses.  I read every single one and cried (except for the posts where the guys were getting technical about shaving their balls).  ‚ù§Ô∏è"
9m3z8i,I (26F) broke up with my boyfriend (31M) and he tried committing suicide hours later,"We were together for two years and I decided to end the relationship yesterday. I ended it because of a few reasons. The biggest reason is because of his anger issues. If I didn‚Äôt do or say exactly what he wanted me to, he would get extremely angry (yelling at the top of his lungs, throwing objects, push me, etc) and say hurtful things. I know you are thinking ‚Äúwhy did she stay with this guy?‚Äù. I would ask myself the same thing over and over but still find myself wanting to stay because I wanted to believe these things would just work itself out. Six months ago, the arguing and fights began to intensify and I started to resent him. Two weeks ago we were in the car and he was criticizing me over a situation I was venting to him about, so I asked him why he always had to critique everything I did (no yelling on my part). He exploded in anger, told he was so angry he wanted to punch me in the face and tried to push me out of the car in the middle of the street with moving traffic. We ended up pulling over in a parking lot and I got out the car to walk on my own because I was scared and couldn‚Äôt believe what was happening. As I started walking off, he gets out of his car and walks into the middle of the road with oncoming traffic and refused to get out of the street until I personally removed him. Cars braked rapidly and there was a lot of honking, while I am crying and pulling this man out of the road. I called a mutual friend of ours who can usually help call him down, and he did. He promised me for the millionth time he wasn‚Äôt going to yell at me again and act out, I decided to let it slide once again. However, I didn‚Äôt really let it slide because I kept replaying that scene over and over again in my head. Last week he yelled at me in the middle of a Dave & Busters over a parking spot, in front of everyone. I have begged him to go to therapy with me and he says it‚Äôs a waste of money and that no therapist knows what they‚Äôre talking about, 

Today, I decided that I needed to end the relationship for good. I wasn‚Äôt happy anymore and his anger had officially pushed me over the edge. I couldn‚Äôt even look at him the same way anymore. I told him everything I was feeling and I figured he would be really upset. He once again promised things would change and to give him a chance, begging me to stay. It hurt but I knew it was the right thing to do. I stood firm and said I no longer wanted to be with him. He started sending me text messages saying he was going to kill himself because of the breakup. I immediately got him on the phone and it just kept getting worse. I tried my best to calm him down but all he wanted to hear was that I would take him back. I didn‚Äôt want to lie to him and couldn‚Äôt give a false promise and he didn‚Äôt take that well. I decided to call his mother because I was afraid he would actually hurt himself. I was at my dad‚Äôs house while this was happening and he ended up going to my apartment (he has a key) to see if he would run into me, He then sent me text messages with pictures of him holding a suicide note and telling me that he loved me but he was done living if he couldn‚Äôt have me. He ended up taking a bunch of pain killers and was drinking alcohol. My roommate found him in my bathroom barely able to stay awake. I rushed home while they called 911. Thankfully, we got him help at the right time and they were able to treat him for the OD. He is now at the hospital on a three day suicide watch. I stayed at the ER until his mother arrived and I spoke to him for a few minutes. He was hazy and crying, it broke my heart even more. I decided to leave to give him some space to rest and clear his head. 

I am battling these feelings that it‚Äôs my fault and I shouldn‚Äôt have broken up with him. Everyone tells me it‚Äôs not but I cant help feeling this way. I am overwhelmed. When I got home, I found the suicide note he wrote me. He had left his bank information and said he was leaving me all his money, and to donate his organs. I don‚Äôt even know what to feel or what to do right now. I am still in shock. Have I really been in a toxic relationship for two years? How did I let it get this bad? What is wrong with me? I want to visit him in the hospital to be there for him as a friend but I am not sure if that is a good idea, I don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like a bad dream."
1kuq0iv,My niece was expecting her bachelorette party to be paid for the second time around and is now very upset that isn't the case.,"My husband and I (55/52) have always paid for the bachelorette party for our nieces, goddaughters and daughter in laws. We cruise alot and enjoy it, went on one for our honeymoon, and I always thought a weekend cruise for a bachelorette would be so fun. So when our first niece married, we sent her bridal party on a short cruise, all included plus spa time as a special gift, and have been doing so for the brides in our family ever since. 

We have a very big family and so yes, brides now know and look forward to their bachelorette party being paid for. I always bring this up when the bride first starts her planning, because cruises also take time to plan. I always work with the MOH and want to make it a really wonderful fun weekend, where the bride doesn't lift a finger and her bridal party doesn't spend a cent. 

Here's the issue, our niece, Leah (33), is marrying for the second time. We are so happy for her, she and her husband to be announced this to the family at Christmas, their wedding is in July. We did not plan on throwing the bachelorette party, when our goddaughter remarried for example, we didn't it wasn't expected. 

We are Mexican and the godparents are very involved in paying for the wedding. Leah's godmother has already declined to pay for the dress or flowers but her godfather is paying for the rehearsal dinner. As far as I know there was no issue with this. 

My other niece, Yvette, recently pulled me aside and let me know that when she was planning a night out bachelorette for her sister Leah, as she's the MOH. She said Leah was surprised by this and assumed she was getting another weekend cruise. Not once has anyone brought this up since the wedding was announced. I do understand that maybe I should have but since we hadn't paid for our goddaughters second bachelorette I didn't think I needed to. Yvette said she tried to calm her sister down and said Leah had a huge meltdown that no one was taking the wedding seriously, no one was helping to make it special, and that she was being punished for being divorced. This isn't the case at all. We are still having a huge huge party, we are still celebrating, it's just not like a first wedding. None of her bridal party, which is all family including my two daughters expected this trip, only the bride. 

I spoke with Leah and I told her how badly I felt that wires had gotten crossed. She told me it was okay and that we could just plan the cruise now. I told her not only was it fairly late to begin planning a cruise for July but her uncle and I didn't plan on paying for a second bachelorette. She was gutted and I felt so bad. 

What do I do here? I told Yvette I could pick up the tab for their night out and pay for a spa day. Yvette told me no, that Leah is just being a brat. I don't think she's being a brat, I do think she is expecting too much. Leah also felt it wasn't fair that I was just paying for one thing when everyone else gets a weekend. 

I just don't want Leah to feel like her wedding isn't being respected or taken seriously. I've even considered setting up a cruise for her and her new husband and having that be our wedding gift. My husband doesn't like that idea, he feels a cash gift and paying for a spa day is more than enough. 

What would you do in my situation? Have I really messed up here? I really feel so badly and would like some outside advice on how to handle this. "
mu7x2h,"I'm 16, I'm pregnant, I need advice now!","I had sex with a friend on my 16th birthday because I wanted to experience it.  It was with a good friend of mine and I initiated it all.   I'm not on birth control.  I didn't think I'd get pregnant and he pulled out to finish but I think he may have squirted in me first.  It doesn't matter because I'm pregnant.  I am over 2 months late and took a test this morning and another after school.   I don't know what to do.  I can't tell my mom, I don't want to tell anyone, I have no one to go to.   I can't get an abortion, I just don't think I can live with that.  I might regret it forever.   I don't know anything right now.   My parents will be home in a few hours and I have no idea what I am going to say or do.  I want to run away but I can't.   I wanted to call my friends but they can't help me.

What the heck am I supposed to do?  Please someone give me advice on how to handle this and what I can tell my mom?  I feel like I am going to burst into tears the moment, I'm that close to the edge right now.   I need help, please someone tell me what to say and who to call and what to do."
j4ergf,Do you clean the toilet after a messy poop?,"Update: Lol thanks for all the feedback; he‚Äôs agreed to clean up from now on. Good work, Internet. 

‚Äî-

My partner thinks it‚Äôs unusual for me to ask him to scrub the toilet bowl if he leaves poop behind. He says that it‚Äôs an OCD request and that normal people don‚Äôt clean up after their poop stains. I‚Äôm not asking for him to use the cleaning solution, just a quick scrub with the brush. I don‚Äôt think this is an odd request. We just moved in together, so this is a frustrating discovery. What say you?"
r0cadi,I want an abortion but my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt.,"Posting from a throwaway.

I‚Äôm about to turn 20, my boyfriend is 28. We have been together 3 months. This was an accident and I was between birth control methods. He‚Äôs ready for a family and loves me dearly however I have been considering breaking up with him before I found out I was pregnant.

If I get an abortion without him knowing and tell him I lost the baby would this be easier for him than me saying I got rid of it? I don‚Äôt want to be tied down with him forever and bringing a child into an unhappy relationship in my opinion is completely unfair. I don‚Äôt want to be with him. I feel trapped. If anyone else has been in a similar situation please tell me your experience.

EDIT: Thank you so much for everyone that has taken the time to read and respond to my post. I see that this is a divided topic and is clearly based on personal opinion but I do think I will tell him I miscarried. This is not only because it will make it easier for him but I could also be in physical danger if he knows I terminated the pregnancy. I have contacted the clinic today and unfortunately they can‚Äôt give me an appointment at this time but they have given me the number to another clinic. Thanks again for everyone who let me know their stance on this."
jwpz6z,How do I break this to my friend lightly?,"So I have a good friend. He's autistic, but a sweet person. He loves music, and is trying to do everything he can to surround his life with music. I'm posting this on multiple subreddits to figure this out. But anyways, we have different tastes in music(He loves Rock centered music and I love rap and R&B), but I definitely cannot deny his gift for music. He can explain how a guitar works better than anyone I have ever met. So, he has an album coming out, it's his first one. He dropped the single and I finally got around to listening to it, and honestly. It's really bad. His vocals are so obviously dependent on autotune it makes me cringe honestly. The Piano didn't change for the fist half of the song, and neither did the drums. The Chorus was kind of cool, but it was just catchy. He asked my opinion on it and I don't want to hurt his feelings. But How do I say I don't think your music has what it takes? I want your opinions on it. I'll post link below so you guys can weigh in an opinion."
uo5he2,I‚Äôm about to receive a blowjob for the first time in my 19 years of life. We‚Äôre meeting in 4 hours. How do I prepare?,
w3k317,I‚Äôm creeped out by what my father just did,"My father opened my door at 3am tonight while I was masturbating but was stopped by my dog (who‚Äôs normally in a crate but luckily wasn‚Äôt tonight) being alerted I‚Äôm not sure what his intentions where but I don‚Äôt think they were good I can‚Äôt tell my mom and I‚Äôm to scarred to sleep what do I do?

I‚Äôll add for more context but (F17) I‚Äôve always been creeped out by him and have caught him looking at my boobs and ass on multiple occasions along with in order for me to not have heard him he had to be very careful since our hallway is loud and I was using a v so I he must have heard what was happening before he decided to open the door my mother has also always been the one to check up on me and she hasn‚Äôt done that in years

Edit: I‚Äôll also put that my mom knows I sleep shirtless because it gets really hot in my room and she told me that she warned my father about it and to not go in without knocking after she went to wake me up one morning and my chest was exposed so he knows that I sleep without any top on

Update: Sorry it‚Äôs been a while I‚Äôve had a lot of stuff happening with school and everything. I just wanted to give an update incase anyone cares. So for I think two months I‚Äôve been sleeping in the guest room downstairs so that it was easier to put my doggies out in the morning and obviously I didn‚Äôt say this but to stay farther away from my father. Because of this and me avoiding him likely nothing else has happened however I am moving back to my old room since my grandpa needs the room I‚Äôll give an update if anything happens right away, and in a few months I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know if nothing has happened. 

And I‚Äôll add yes I understand many of y‚Äôall want me to tell my mom I can‚Äôt. She never believes me on anything I‚Äôve never understood it but no matter what she believes my father and my siblings over me any day and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll get in trouble if I tell her, so as much as y‚Äôall want me to I can‚Äôt talk to her about this.

Update because some people where asking for one:
I haven‚Äôt had any other problems with my father since but I pretty much avoid him at all costs luckily he‚Äôs been away more recently for the military but when I‚Äôm around him I can definitely feel him staring at me whenever I‚Äôm in something even slightly revealing I would love to move out now that I‚Äôm 18 and get away from him but my parents won‚Äôt let me work while I‚Äôm in school and if I did find a job that they would ‚Äúokay‚Äù it all has to go into my savings account and I can‚Äôt touch it so even though I want to leave I have no way of being able to pay for myself or pay for a place to stay"
li84c6,UPDATE: Strange behaviour from new downstairs neighbour,"I thought I would just post a quick update in regards to [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l9deas/strange\_behaviour\_from\_new\_downstairs\_neighbour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l9deas/strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs_neighbour/)

Thanks for your advice everyone.

So I have been keeping the recordings. On the next evening, I contacted the police saying I was concerned about her behaviour not that I was complaining about the nuisance. They advised me to contact Lewisham Environmental Health Office, as it was late I didn't really think about it but the next day I realised someone was just fobbing me off, what has it got to do with EHO? So I didn't bother

Over the next few days, it escalated, becoming more frequent so I contacted them again only to be told they have noted it down but there is nothing they can do at this stage but to keep informing them. It continued to escalate that day, getting more violent [http://dropshare.rebelinblue.com/LSmiHNmm6Fg0hNLJMzVQ/](http://dropshare.rebelinblue.com/LSmiHNmm6Fg0hNLJMzVQ/) so I contacted them at 10pm and they said they would report it to the Safer Neighbour Team who would contact me.

The next day they turned up, although there was some confusion because even though I have a SE26 postcode which is Sydenham I am actually in Forest Hill (looked it up and the boundary literally runs down the middle of the road so one side is Sydenham the other Forest Hill). I showed them the footage, including videos at 2am and 4am and they agreed that it is creepy and concerning, they asked if I wanted them to speak to her but said it possibly wasn't a good idea until they can report it to the correct Neighbourhood Team as it may make things escalate further. I agreed. So they gave me the contact details for the Forest Hill team and asked me to email them the videos.

Before I got round to it I got a phone call from the team just confirming how to get to the flat (it is a bit of a PITA to find) but as I was out I said they may not be able to get in as the front door is normally locked and I am the only one with a doorbell.

We agreed that they would talk to her as if there was a concern for her rather than about her. They phoned me back in the afternoon and said they had spoken to her and she seemed normal if maybe a bit slow, she denied knocking on the door and they said they had seen footage to which she said she was just knocking to chat and they told her it was not appropriate at 4 in the morning. At this stage, I think they assumed I was probably someone just complaining about a noisy neighbour and she maybe wasn't very bright and hadn't realised the problem with knocking at 4 in the morning. But they asked me to send them the videos so I sent a couple of choice highlights like the one above and one of her racing up the stairs doing it and racing back down... I got back the reply ""OK Yeah, those videos speak for themselves don't they!""

They concluded, like I had, that she was unwell so referred the case to social services. They advised that maybe she was sleepwalking and that I should maybe get a stair gate for now. I said I didn't want to because I was worried that if she was sleepwalking she may try and climb over and hurt herself but I would keep it under advisement.

Tuesday night she kept me up most of the night, then again Wednesday night, I missed work yesterday due to lack of sleep. At this point I thought ""fuck it I really don't care if she hurts herself now"" so brought a stair gate... but I am not an arsehole so did look for one wide enough to go on the landing so that if she fell she wouldn't fall down the stairs but unfortunately the only one I could find was 4 to 6 weeks delivery so settled for one on the top of the stairs. I also contacted the officier again to ask if there was any news and he said once it had been referred it was out of their hands so he had no idea but said I might want to report it again and consider a harassment report.

I informed the freeholder than I was installing a gate at the advice of the police and his response was simply ""OK thanks"".

Yesterday I was out at the shop over the road and she came in, she left before me and after I came out she came running across the road saying she had locked herself out of her flat and could she wait in mine, obviously there was no chance so I made up a lie about just doing some shopping then going to a meeting so I put my shopping away and went out for a walk. By the time I was back someone had come with the key thankfully.

I installed the stairgate last night when it arrived.

She didn't knock overnight but I am 99% sure that is a pure coincidence as the camera would have caught her coming up the stairs... Literally, as I said this to a colleague she came up the stairs, climbed over and banged on the door.

It slowed her down enough for me to get to the door to confront her but she just ignored me. A few minutes later she came out and opened the gate. So I went out and put a bike lock on it to see what happened.

Half an hour later the camera has her coming out, checking to see if I was there then realising there is something on the gate so examining it, then when I came out she legged it. That was enough evidence for the police to finally take it seriously, sleepwalking people don't check to see if anyone is watching them or stop to examine locks so they are sending someone out today but said to phone back immediately if she becomes aggressive.

She's been back to look at it a few times so far.

Exhausting!

stkq9q,Is it unreasonable to consider divorce after discovering my husband‚Äôs kinks?,"Posting on a second account as my husband knows the username of my main account. Please read the whole post if you have the time.

I will have been married to my husband for three years next month. Been together for six years total. Like all couples, we‚Äôve had our ups and downs but he is the love of my life. Since the beginning of our relationship, I have always told him how family was very important to me and that being a mother was my ultimate life goal. I‚Äôve always wanted nothing more than to have children, give them the best life I could give them, and protect them with all that I have. He knew this and agreed that family and children are a big deal for him as well. But we wanted to wait until we were done with our education and stable before we pursued having children.

Early November, we decided to start TTC (Trying to Conceive) and this is when things started taking a turn. We agreed that though we are trying for a baby, we still wanted to make the sex exciting and didn‚Äôt want it to feel like a chore. So we decided to start trying new kinks and fetishes to make things fresh and fun. Mid-summer, he expressed he wanted to try out DDLG. For this kink, he would be the daddy and I would be the little girl. My roles consisted of wearing pacifiers, children‚Äôs girl underwear, and to talk like a baby while he would talk like a parent calling me ‚Äúprincess‚Äù and ‚Äúbabygirl‚Äù. He would also mention my intimate area as ‚Äúprincess parts‚Äù. Thought I thought it was an interesting kink, I didn‚Äôt complain and just went with it.

Well he ended up liking the role-play so much that it became a common occurrence and he wanted to do DDLG at least two or three times a week because he ‚Äúloved the lifestyle‚Äù. Again, strange but I was so busy with life and tracking my cycles that I pushed it off. Then comes January. He expressed that he wants to try out incest role-play. The main roles he wanted to try out were Mother/Son and Father/Daughter. I honestly wasn‚Äôt okay with this one and expressed this to him, but he convinced me that it was to just add spice and keep things fun. So I went along with it. But this morning everything changed. My husband has a habit of falling asleep to Youtube videos or Twitch streams so he often wakes up with his phone on low battery since it‚Äôs just on all night. I woke up this morning (I‚Äôm usually up before him) to see that his phone screen was on while he was asleep. So I picked it up to put it on the charging stand and on his phone, I saw porn. The video that he had finished watching was a Father Daughter incest porn video. I opened up his Safari history and saw that he had been viewing just father and daughter incest porn since around the time we started the DDLG role-play.

Maybe it‚Äôs extreme but I am considering a divorce because I can not imagine having a child with my husband with everything I‚Äôve found. I feel bad but I can not continue this relationship if we can‚Äôt have children sometime in the future. And right now I‚Äôm unsure of having children with him. As I said, being a mother means everything to me and I would hate to put my children in a dangerous situation. It would hurt me if I found out that my child got harmed and it was partly due to my poor choices. I recognize that watching a certain porn doesn‚Äôt mean you would actually do these things but it‚Äôs evident he‚Äôs been really into this for awhile and he gets so passionate whenever we role-play scenarios where he plays a father figure and I play his child. It‚Äôs scaring me.

TLDR; My husband has been fixated on incest-related kinks when we‚Äôre trying to have a baby and it‚Äôs making me consider divorce.

Edit: I have decided I‚Äôm going to proceed with a divorce. I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any coming back from this and my future kids are too important to me. I can‚Äôt afford to gamble on something so serious, as I could potentially help be the cause of some life changing damage and trauma. I think it would be best for us to go our separate ways. I will always love him and I wish him the best, just not with me. Thanks everyone for your thoughts."
a9h65f,Girlfriend cheated on me with my brother last night. Parents are mad at me for leaving before Xmas.,"Backstory:
My parents wanted me and my brother to stay at their house over night for Xmas eve. My girlfriend has trouble sleeping alone so I decided to take her with me for the night.

Now, my GF and my brother had had a weird relationship a while back and he was manipulative enough that she developed some strange tendencies about him, similar to that of an abusive relationship.

The Event: My GF and I are going to sleep. I pass out and wake up 15 minutes later to the sound of distant moaning. I get out of bed and the hair stands up on the back of my neck as I realize that my GF is not in my room. I sneak out into the hallway and I hear my GF giggling and laughing from my brothers room. I hear her whisper ‚Äúbe careful‚Äù.

I march straight into my brothers room where I find my brother pretending to be asleep (but still obviously breathing heavily) and my GF laying next to him. She still has her clothes on and she acts like nothing is going on but she‚Äôs being a little defensive.

I ask her what happened and she eventually admits that he had kissed her. She also later admits that she was moaning because he was touching her. She started off saying that she stopped him as soon as she could and that she only went in there to talk to him. I brought up that she could have left a lot sooner and that I could hear her moaning and she admired that she didn‚Äôt intend for things to get sexual, but she did let it happen because she still had feelings for him.

GF drove back home in the middle of the night and I soon did the same, sending my parents a quick heads up explaining why I left.

Present:
Now I‚Äôm getting texts from both my parents saying that they are sad that I left and that family should stick together. My mom said that she‚Äôs sorry I got caught up between my brother and GF which makes me feel like she didn‚Äôt respect my relationship with her and that it was always more about her and y brother.

They want me to hear my brothers side of the story. He has a history of using women and my parents usually respond with ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just not a relationship guy‚Äù even though he uses obvious manipulation tactics.

I really thought my parents would have my back on this one. Why does it feel like they care less about my situation and just want me to forgive my brother so we can have a normal Christmas?

What do I do?!

Update: Turns out my brother never made a move and she was the one trying to start shit. We‚Äôve been together for almost a year now and I had no idea she was manipulating me the whole time. Feels like a mind-fucky plot twist at the end of a movie. My brain is inside out.

Final update:
I am absolutely dumping my GF. I recommended that she get psychiatric help because she shows some big signs of BPD. However, I also made it clear that what she did was unforgivable. No coming back from that.

It‚Äôs also apparent that both the GF and my brother were lying about what actually happened. There‚Äôs no reason for her to confess to messing around with him if it didn‚Äôt happen; odds are, my brother is lying about being innocent in the matter.

For my family‚Äôs sake, I will try to get along with him on holidays, but I absolutely do not trust him.

Thank you all for your support. It really means a lot to me. I never would have thought that this could happen to me and it‚Äôs honestly a bit surreal.

Also my now-ex got me a super nice espresso machine for Christmas and I sure as hell intend on taking it with me."
z8vhe1,I'm not allowed to wear bras around the house and it's making me uncomfortable,My dad is super old fashioned. He basically doesn't let me do anything unless it's extremely necessary. He's always been that way but he got worse after my mom left. He only lets me wear bras to school but I'm not allowed to wear them at home. According to him bras slow down growth. Anytime I try to explain that's it's complete nonsense he just gets angry and I get grounded. Idk what to do.
p9d01y,How the fuck do I wake this guy up?!,"He‚Äôs sleeping on my floor, and he‚Äôs got tea with his grandmother soon, but nothing I do wakes him up.


Ive shook him and talked loudly and al the rest of it. He‚Äôs definitely alive- breathing and all that, but he has an hour walk to get home and I don‚Äôt want his grandmother to be sad that he missed tea.


Someone asked for an update:

Something strong smelling was suggested, alongside breakfast- so I‚Äôve just combined those two ideas and I‚Äôm making him breakfast. If that doesn‚Äôt get him up I‚Äôm sitting on him.


Update 2:

Breakfast did the trick, the smell of sausage sandwich and ketchup made him rise from the half dead state, he‚Äôs currently munching and complaining about being tired.

I‚Äôve also learned that the vast majority of Reddit is sadistic."
enrf6h,"I am 14 and pregnant, please help","I need help. I am 14F and I have recently discovered that I am in fact pregnant. The father is very supportive and is actually really happy about the situation, but he is most definitely against abortion meaning he wants to keep the child. I on the other hand, kind of want to get an abortion because this whole pregnancy thing is scary, but I'm also not against keeping it. I just don't know what to do, mostly due to the fact that I don't even know how to tell my parents let alone raise a child while I still am one. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Update: Thank you so much for everyone that commented with their support and opinions! It has honestly helped and calmed me down a bit."
181yqfe,My [28M] wife [25F] ruined our honeymoon,"This is going to be a very long one, I apologize in advance. My wife and I got married very recently this year, in a gorgeous ceremony, surrounded by our friends and family. We were together for 4 years prior. This last year has been monumentally stressful for the two of us, both work-wise and with the wedding planning. However, the day couldn't have been more perfect and it was undoubtedly the absolute best day of our lives, making all of the trouble and stress more than worth it.

I make very good money and provide for the both of us, while my wife takes care of finances/bills, plans our trips and generally keeps me uplifted when I'm stressed with work. I adore my wife, she's beautiful, smart, extremely well read and has always shared my sense of humor. When we met, I couldn't believe that there was someone as wonderfully goofy and weird as I was and I knew very early on that she was the one for me. We made it through the pandemic together, through distance at times and I never thought that anything could sway my feelings for her.

We booked an expensive honeymoon, in a tropical location, scheduled a few weeks after the wedding. She'd been there before and told me she had always wanted to go back. I paid, while she, as per usual organized the trip. The first few days were amazing. We're not super active on our vacations and were just happy to drink, go to the beach for the whole day and out to nice dinners in the evening. The second hotel we stayed at is where things took a turn.
While out, my wife and I started chatting to a few other couples at a beachside bar/restaurant. We're both very social, so we like asking other couples about themselves, sharing funny comparisons and including each other in the laughs. She was getting a little tipsy, but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. At some point, she began to start slipping into 'drunk' territory and I started ordering us more food and suggesting she take it easy, which she obliged. Despite this, she later kept ordering more drinks. I asked her to please take it easy, because I know her pacing at this stage. She got quite agitated and stated that this was her honeymoon too and she wanted to relax. While talking some more, she got noticeably more drunk, pretty fast. I was talking to the couple on my right, when I heard my wife tell the girl next to her that she had a 'one that got away', who she wished she 'hadn't let go' and that she settled for me. My face, my stomach, my heart, everything dropped. I can't imagine what I must have looked like in that moment, but the people she was talking to got very quiet and awkward, the couple next to me tried changing the subject. Still, my wife went on.

She gestured toward me and began to discuss that I wasn't her type at all and went on to describe something entirely different. We had both made jokes in the past about not being each others initial type, but that since meeting each other, we were both the 'type' we both never knew we wanted. It seems this wasn't true on her end. She patted my head condescendingly and said ""unfortunately, this was the best I could do, but life goes on"". She wasn't laughing. She was completely deadpan. I was absolutely crushed. This didn't seem at all like the person I had been with over the last 4 years. I tried to get her to put her drink down, let me pay the check and leave when she outright snapped. The waitress had refused her when she asked for another drink and she stormed off to the bathroom. At this stage, the people she was talking to had migrated tables and the couple next to me were trying to reassure me, despite the bomb that had clearly gone off. I went to go check on her after a few minutes. This turned to 20 more minutes, after which the waiting staff had to go in and retrieve her. She had been getting sick in the bathroom. She didn't say a word to me when she got out and just grabbed her stuff. In the interim, the other couple had picked up our check, which I was incredibly embarrassed about, but grateful for. The parted ways saying ""happy honeymoon"" in awkward wincing smiles.

I left with her, feeling utterly dumbstruck, embarrassed, concerned and above all just heartbroken. She spent the entire walk back to the hotel saying that she knew I was embarrassed of her behaviour, adding ""you know what, I don't care, you're an embarrassment most of the time"". She went to point out that she that I was not funny or charismatic, as she had said in the past, but a clown, a laughing stock, and that our friends only put up with me out of niceties. She said that they all just saw me as a complete joke and that I was just too stupid to notice. This was all being screamed at me in front of as many people as you can imagine a popular destination spot would have walking around in the main town, all while I was trying to keep her from stumbling out onto the street. I had turned from embarrassed and upset to completely numb. I felt as though my marriage had detonated then and there. I'm ashamed to say this, but in that moment, I imagined leaving her as soon as I got back home and the ensuing embarrassment of having to explain to friends and family that my marriage had not even lasted a season without crumbling.

We were getting into a semi crowded elevator when she squirmed out and bolted off. I immediately ran back down 3 stories and spent the next 45 minutes trying to locate her on the hotel premise. Finally we got back to the room and she fell straight to sleep on the bed. I rolled her onto her side, tucked her in and got her water. We were going to our 3rd stop at a resort the following morning, so I just stayed up and packed. To say I felt empty inside is a complete understatement. She woke up about 2-3 hours later asking what had happened. Why I looked so upset. I asked if she was actually serious. If the most devastating part of our relationship, of any relationship I had ever been in had not JUST happened for her. She seemed anxious, as if it were less than half coming back to her, so I told her everything she had done, as calmly as I could. I told her how much she had hurt and embarrassed me with what she had said.

She was hysterical. She started screaming into the pillows, trying to hurt herself, screaming that she had ruined our honeymoon and our marriage, begging me not to leave her, telling me she didn't mean it. She was still fairly drunk. I told her to just go back to sleep, that I needed to go for a walk and have some time to think. She refused to give me it. She grabbed my arm while I asked her to let go, scratching me while I told her to just let me have space, screaming all the while. I stopped and just got into bed and told her I could not talk to her. We both went to sleep, but she woke me multiple times, telling me that we needed to talk through this and that I owed her that much. I just told her that I couldn't. I was shattered. I told her I didn't even know if I could finish the rest of the honeymoon and that I didn't know if I could go to the final resort we were staying at.

I woke the next morning. She had cancelled our 5 day resort stay that we were due to be at in 6 hours, of which I received no refund. She cried, she apologized, she begged for me to hear her out, but there was literally nothing that could fix what she had said and how she talked to me after, in that moment. She told me that it wasn't her, that she remembered none of it and that she couldn't even begin to think of why she had said and done those things. That it wasn't how she felt at all and that I was the best thing that had ever happened to her, that I had to believe her, after everything we had been through. Asking why I couldn't just trust her after all of this time together.

This is getting very long, so to put the rest of the trip briefly, she used her savings to pay for a very expensive resort for us that day, apologizing for cancelling the other one without asking first. She wanted to save the trip. For the rest of the trip she was remorseful, she was kind, she was sweet, she was the person that I had fallen in love with. She seemed just as shattered and upset as I was. I tried to make the most of the rest of our stay, but it was obvious that I was still heartbroken, despite trying to keep it together. She cried on the plane home and she cried most of the day we got back.
Fast forward a couple of very awkward, sad and tense days, she comes to me and lays out all of the changes she was going to make. She has always done the laundry but didn't really do a lot of the cleaning or cooking. In recent months she would often get agitated when I would finish work and start doing it. She promised to do all or at least most of the household stuff, to take the pressure off of me. She started dressing up, doing her makeup more often, she even cooked me a fancy dinner and decorated, to show how much she appreciated me and the life I had given her (her words, not mine). She told me that she had only said those things because she was insecure about not working, about herself in our friend group and how she had felt that our mutual friends liked me more than her. I don't believe that last part to be true in the slightest. More than half of them were actually her friends before they were mine. I asked about the 'one that got away', as difficult as it was and she said that she didn't know why she said that but she didn't feel that way. She said that I was her type, that I was the only one for her and that she would spend as long as it took to make it up to me.

We see a lot of relationship posts reuploaded to tiktok and one thing I absolutely cannot stand is that the couples cannot seem to fathom the concept of actually communicating to each other in situations like this... and that's what we did. We communicated. We talked openly and honestly. I told her firmly and candidly about all of the changes I needed. I asked about what I needed to change, what could have made her so full of contempt for me in that moment on our honeymoon and what we could both do to avoid it. Things started to pick up over the next few days and it seemed like things were going to be ok. There were some lingering things, of course. I wasn't initiating intimacy, I just couldn't. I felt like a complete loser. I felt completely undesirable. Questioning how anyone could see anything in me, if this is how she felt. She tried on multiple occasions, but I just asked her for time to recover. She gave me that space and reassured me that she would wait as long as it took for me to feel up to it again. We both always had a high sex drive and that was now completely shot.

Finally over time, we were intimate again, she cooked, cleaned, did sweet things for me, acted like she did when we first met. It really did feel like this whole nightmare might have been a net positive. Like it had kicked some things that were off in our relationship back into place. Like it was the wakeup call we needed. I still had intrusive thoughts, but we communicated and she would compliment and reassure me. She would constantly ask if how she was acting and the things she was doing for me were noticeable. I told her that they were and that I appreciated them and I tried to be more aware of any flaws I myself might have in my day to day.
It's been some weeks since then and things have started to slip back. The nice dinners stopped almost immediately, as did the nice gestures. She's started to become irritable with me with small things, unrelated to me. She's stopped doing household things consistently and is again irritable when I ask if she can help with them, while I'm working. I don't work the longest hours on earth by any means, but my work weeks are 60 to sometimes 70 hours. I'll find her downstairs playing video games or watching streams and asking her to help out is leading to strained discussions at times. She doesn't not do housework at all, but it's absolutely noticeably less already. She had started therapy through Betterhelp (I have no experience with that app and don't know if it is reputable) but that stopped after about 2 weeks. We have long discussions and things get better momentarily, but they keep resetting and I feel like I'm in a sate of d√©j√† vu with everything. Again, I previously stated that I hate that couples can't just talk to each other in these kind of posts, but we've been talking. She'll turn around and still do sweet things, but I just can't bring myself to look past what happened sometimes and it's still eating at me. My confidence is completely fine some days and others it is just on the floor.

I still love her, but I cannot say with any confidence that I feel ""in love"" with her anymore and I don't know what to do. I never thought I would see myself on this end of one of these posts. She's talked to her mother about it and I cannot bring myself to say anything to my parents or friends. I'm so embarrassed and haven't been able to confide in anyone about this, aside from her. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. Any advice movement forward would be so appreciated. Have a wonderful day, all of you.

(TL;DR: My wife drunkenly said she settled for me and is still holding a candle for someone else, on our honeymoon. Then she said I was a joke)

Edit: Oh my goodness, thank you all for your messages, no matter what your opinions were, I appreciate all of them and I appreciate you all giving your time and advice. I only just work up, so sorry for not responding sooner. I really wasn't expecting this turnout in the comments. Being able to get the story off of my chest, outside of talking to her, is in itself some form of relief. 

I see a lot of people writing that my wife married me for the money. I really should have added that when we got engaged, we did not have much money at all. Sorry for not including it initially, I wrote this at around 1-2am my time, and the grammatical errors reflect that. We got engaged in the middle of the pandemic, work had dried up in my field and we were both banking on my plan to pay off. She always said she believed I could be successful, but I was by no means close to being financially sound when she said yes to marrying me. However that said, take from that what you will. 

I'm trying my best to read through all of the messages. I'll be honest, a lot are difficult to process. I see, acknowledge and appreciate the ones telling me to look out for my best interests, but also the ones telling me to actually ask my wife about her aspirations or goals, which surely cannot be sitting around/household tasks. In the past it's been touchy and/or difficult to get her to pursue the field of her degree. It's creative and daunting and she has often gotten defensive and dismissive of my help in the past. This morning I asked her to lay out a realistic and specific plan to get back into working, with the goal of working towards the career she actually wants.

I have never been to therapy, but I'm going to look into one on one sessions and go from there, no matter what outcome, after reading this, I clearly need to work on me, whatever that might entail. I'm going away on a trip with some guy friends for a couple of days and while they are our mutual friends, I'm going to try and open up to them as non-biased as I can. Thank you all for sharing your own past experiences so candidly with me and for the DM's also. I know that these next steps seem like baby steps and might be frustrating to read from your end, but we are both religious, divorce is not the option I want to go down if I can help it. However, you're all right. I cannot be miserable for the rest of my life and if no effort is made, it's looking like that might have to be a route. With that said, your words have given me comfort, and while they haven't restored all of my self confidence, they have shown me that I have to actually buck up, be more direct and not be so malleable.

I will update in the coming weeks. Thank you all so much again, I really mean it. Have a wonderful day, you kind souls."
13zswsy,I found a tracking device in my spare tire compartment placed by my husband,"I have had a sneaking suspicion that I was being tracked for over a month now. Last night I went out with some friends and he knew exactly where I was so I went through my car when I got home and found a cellphone connected to a battery pack in my spare tire compartment. I haven't ever been unfaithful or given him a reason to not trust me, I am beyond mad and feel like this is obviously a huge invasion of privacy.
I come to here to ask what I should do with the tracking device, he doesn't know I know about it yet. I have considered running it over, or putting it in his car are there any funnier options? The relationship is over, the tracking device was my last straw so now I just want to have a little fun.

Editing to add more details: the car is mine, in my name. No, he isn‚Äôt interested in making sure the car stays safe, I have an AirTag in my car for this purpose that he is aware of and he would of had a conversation with me about it if his intentions were good.
Another common comment, I own the house we live in. We have been together 10 years I can‚Äôt just disappear off into the night lol

Update: first off, thank you for everyone who gave me advice, support and for some laughs through this. This is how I deal with things, some say it‚Äôs immature - maybe that‚Äôs true - but, I bet I laugh more than you. Dark humor is ok to have. üòò

Secondly, the update is going to be boring. I took it out of my car once he left town and it‚Äôs been sitting in my living room for a few days now. He will either mention it to me when he thinks I‚Äôm not going to work or I will confront him about it when he gets home. Either way, a hard line was crossed and it will end in some form of dissolution. 

For those passing judgement: I also never thought that this would be a big deal, until it happened and I realized how firm of a boundary it really was. It‚Äôs a cellphone he pays for monthly, a battery pack he has to charge and maintain. It‚Äôs a decision he makes over and over again every month, several times a month for however long it‚Äôs been in my car. I give him no reason to not trust me, this is solely based off of insecurity or his own prior (potentially current) infidelities. We all have boundaries, this apparently is one of mine."
103b7vw,Planned Parenthood Broke HIPAA,"Planned Parenthood Broke HIPAA laws and called my mom
For context, I am 19 years old and in college. I found out I was pregnant a week and a half ago and thought hard but ultimately decided i cannot give a baby what it needs right now. I scheduled my appointment for planned parenthood and decided that i would never tell my parents. right after i had left my mom knew i was pregnant, she said one of her old friends she used to work with works there and called her to let her know that i was getting an abortion, she confirmed my full name and my cell phone number and stated that she knew she was breaking HIPAA but she had to tell my mom. My whole life has been turned upside down since this lady told my mom, my parents help me out financially a lot which i am so grateful for while i am in school and i have been cut off completely as well as called a slut or a whore every 5 minutes by my mom. my father won‚Äôt even speak to me. What should i do?




Update: Thank you guys for all the kind comments I have received. I haven‚Äôt done anything yet as this is so recent. I think I am going to get a consultation with a lawyer and talk about my options. I am just scared to burn bridges with my parents for good and this lady is my moms friend so I think she might disown me, I think I can figure out my financial situations because I do have a job and just got offered a promotion so paying my rent shouldn‚Äôt be an issue and I can get financial aid i hope. If I don‚Äôt end up taking this to court I will still alert planned parenthood of her breaking hipaa laws and hopefully she won‚Äôt be able to do this to other girls. Honestly, I am just scared beyond belief and am heartbroken to say the least, I love my family even though sometimes they don‚Äôt treat me well. I will update again when I fully decide but I am taking each comment into consideration. Also i don‚Äôt think PP is a bad organization at all I think there is just a bad person working there which is another reason I‚Äôm hesitant because I wouldn‚Äôt want to harm some girls only option for safe termination."
af7jcu,Girlfriends parents making me pay 200$,"&#x200B;

My girlfriend for 2 months told me she had unlimited phone call minutes so she used to call me everyday for hours and we would sleep on the phone but she then finds out that she had to pay 400$ for the phone bill and now her parents want me to pay half of that since she spent 200$ calling me what should i do?

1kbs7b4,My Stepdad keeps walking in on me showering,"Hi I'm (16) F and I shower around the same time every morning, and I am 100% sure that when I enter the bathroom I always lock the door but mt step dad after like 30 minutes, will come by and unlock the door and step inside and I'll say like ""uh.. what"" and he will just say ""yep"" like he's confirming I'm the one in the bathroom?? He only stands there for a minute or so He has done this like 4 or 5 times and I feel like after every single time it's always me then that isn't what he's doing yk.. it's like weird tho idk how to feel
(Edit)
I thought about telling my mom but I just feel like she wouldn't take it seriously? Also it's only happening when she isn't home (she leaves early in the morning for work around 6 I shower at 7-8) he also has his own bathroom in his room"
uudvn6,my boyfriend is suspected of having sex with our 14 year old neighbour,"my boyfriend (26m) and i (20f) have been dating for a little over 4 years. about a year and 1/2 ago we moved into an apartment together. we live next door to a father (mid40s m) and his daughter (14f), who my bf has been tutoring 2 or 3 times a week for the last 8ish months. she was struggling with school and her father works long hours so my bf volunteered to help her with her studies. i didn‚Äôt see anything odd about that at the time because my bf is planning on becoming a teacher. 

i don‚Äôt know how, but a few days ago it was discovered that the daughter has been being sexually abused, and my bf has been interviewed by the police a couple of times in regards to this. he assured me that they have to interview any male in contact with her and that it doesn‚Äôt mean anything, but i‚Äôm extremely worried. i have no idea what to do in this situation and what to believe, and desperately need some advice. what should i do? how do i handle this??? any advice is appreciated"
slr1f6,Found CP on my father's computer.,"Me (19M) and my dad (52M) live together in a condo. My mom (53F) and him are separated, if that matters.

For context, here is how our living room in the condo is set up: both my dad's and my PC setups are in the living room, facing toward opposing walls.

Anyway, I come home to the condo after a doctor's appointment. I go and sit down at my desk as usual. My dad and I are conversing about my appointment, just usual casual talk. While we're talking, he looks away casually to look at the kitchen (away from the living room), and I look away at the same time at his computer screen. He already has a bad habit of keeping applications open on his computer, even when he is away or asleep.

At a glance, I see pornography. I personally don't think much of it, because it isn't a crime to have porn. The man is single, so hey, everyone needs to get off sometimes. However, it did look strange. It was a paused video on an MP4 player, in a small window on his computer. He has other windows open too, but it's just normal casual Youtube stuff.

I don't think he noticed that I saw what was on his screen. In fact, I don't even think he knew it was on his screen. He probably thought he closed it earlier or something.

He says he's going to get ready to play pool, so he goes to his room and the bathroom. While he's away,  I take a closer look at what's on his screen, and sure enough... it's of a little boy. Like no debate, it is of an underage child.

I wanted to throw up and cry, I didn't think he would do anything like this. If there's one file, there's more on his hard drive for sure, right?

I needed to play it off that I never noticed, once he comes back and tells me he's leaving to go play pool. So I hop on a game on my own computer to make it seem like I was too distracted by my own gaming to even notice what's on his computer screen across the room behind me. About 20 minutes later, he comes out, turns off his computer, and says he's leaving, all while I'm playing the game. It seems that it worked.

I told my mother about what happened. I'm staying at my mom's place now. She seems to have the perspective about how to keep the family together, but I personally think this is already past a family matter. This isn't a victimless crime. I don't even know how long this has been going on. He's always been a good father to me, but I feel so disgusted. Has he ever looked at me the same way he looks at those little boys? How does he even acquire this stuff?

What should I do? Should I file an anonymous claim? Should I confront him? Tell him to seek help?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

My girlfriend (19F) comes over on the weekends sometimes, and she prefers staying at my dad's condo than my mom's house, as there's more to do. I haven't told her anything about what I discovered about my father. I don't feel comfortable bringing her to the condo, especially if she's sleeping over. What should I tell her, if anything?

Also, my dad's own father has a history of pedophilia as well. My dad grew up to hate and despise him, as he abused and molested his own children. I feel that my dad, who knows well how child abuse and pedophilia can ruin a family, should know so much better than to do this."
p47jzn,I want an abortion. My boyfriend already told his parents about future grandchild.,"Hello. So myself (27F) and my boyfriend (27m) have been together for about 7 years and accidentally got pregnant roughly 4 weeks ago. I‚Äôm on the pill and we use condoms so I‚Äôm really surprised this happened.

I‚Äôve been very open with everyone in my and my bfs family‚Äôs that I DO NOT want children. I have an autoimmune disorder that makes it very likely I‚Äôll experience some kind of complications and possibly die during pregnancy. I also don‚Äôt have strong maternal instincts and hate being around small children.

I told my bf that somehow I was pregnant and I would be going to the doctor as soon as possible to schedule an abortion. (They are legal in my country before 20-30 weeks) 
But when I got back home today my bfs parents were there and both of them hugged me and congratulated me on ‚Äúfinally getting pregnant.‚Äù And were so excited to be grandparents. I had to tell them ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs not safe for me to keep a baby. I don‚Äôt want children and we aren‚Äôt in a financial place to have one.‚Äù
My bfs mom started crying and there was a lot of yelling back and forth about it.

I finally said ‚Äúit‚Äôs my body so I have the final say. I will not put my life or my future at risk just so you can have grandchildren.‚Äù I than got into my car and drove to my parents house where I have been for the past few days.

My bf keeps calling me trying to convince me to keep the baby and his parents keep texting me begging me to not ‚Äúkill their grand baby‚Äù. I‚Äôm so furious he told them and now they are pressuring me and making me feel terrible about my decision.

My parents said they would support me no matter what choice I end up making. 

I‚Äôm sure someone out there has had a similar problem. So please tell me, how did you handle it? Did your relationship survive?

Should I risk my life to possibly have the only child I will ever have?
Should I have an abortion to make sure I stay safe?"
w63g2u,I caught my cousin and brother making out‚Ä¶what do I do?,"I walked in on my cousin and my brother making out. I‚Äòm 14, my brother is 15 and my cousin is 16 (all male). We‚Äôve been close since childhood, always running around together and playing video games, yk, what kids do. In the past year I‚Äôve noticed them getting closer, but ofc just thought they were bonding so I didn‚Äôt really suspect anything. Two days ago we all met at our yearly family gathering, it was really fun and I got to see a lot of people that I missed. My brother, my cousin and I decided that we want to stay at my grandparents house for a few more days so that we can hang out because we don‚Äôt see each other that much anymore. Yesterday, i went out for a little to get food from the store across the street. It took me a bit longer because we eat a LOT of snacks and it was like shopping for a family of 5. When I came back after around an hour or so I noticed it was quiet, which is very weird for us since we‚Äôre all very loud. I walked upstairs to the bedroom we shared to figure out why and when I opened the door my brother was on top on my cousin and they were making out. Like heavily making out. My brother wasn‚Äôt wearing a shirt and his hands were all over my cousin. I just kinda froze and they jumped apart. My cousin started crying and my brother instantly comforted him, he himself also tearing up. I awkwardly stood before walking out. I just kinda sat on the porch for a bit, processing what just happened. My brother came out of the house and we awkwardly sat in silence for a while before he spoke up. He said ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs weird but me and [name] really love each other. I‚Äôm sorry you found out this way.‚Äù And walked off. It‚Äôs been really awkward and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt really know how I feel about it either. I, for one, didn‚Äôt know either of them were gay. I‚Äôm in no way homophobic, my girlfriend is bi and I have a lot of gay friends who I support fully, although I am straight (I think). But secondly, we are literally related. Our dads are brothers, and I see both of them as brothers. I mean they‚Äôre happy, but yet again oh my god. Im definitely not going to tell anyone in our family, I don‚Äôt want to ruin their relationship even if it‚Äôs a bit weird. But I also don‚Äôt know, I feel like our relationship isn‚Äôt going to be the same, and I kinda don‚Äôt want to be that close to them anymore, which makes me feel bad. What should I do?

EDIT: I talked to them earlier and we had a long discussion about it. I told them that I do support them being gay, but I‚Äôm not sure about their relationship. They said they understood and I asked for a bit of space. I also promised them that I won‚Äôt tell an adult, or anyone I know irl for that matter. I asked how long they had been a thing and they said 11 months, so it‚Äôs been going on a for a bit. I told them I was happy that they found love but am slightly weirded out. Im currently not talking to either for them for at least a few days and just taking my time to think, Ty for the advice!

Also, for all the people assuming I‚Äôm in the US and stuff, I‚Äôm German, live there and all this is happening in Germany. Please stop making Alabama jokes, it‚Äôs annoying :)"
p3sibk,"Wife has given hall pass, no idea how to use it‚Ä¶","I‚Äôve been happily married to my wife for 10+ years, we have 2 awesome kids together, and we are an awesome team.  We‚Äôve had some ups and downs but things are going perfect.  We definitely want to grow old together and raise our kids together.

She‚Äôs recently gone on some meds to help with her mental health, which has driven her sex drive to almost non-existence.  The little sex drive she does have she prefers to control herself.  She assures me there is nothing I can do to improve her experience in the bedroom.  and she has candidly told me she would support (and even pay if necessary) me to seek physical intimacy elsewhere.  

I don‚Äôt want to demand sexy time from her, and I don‚Äôt want her to feel guilty about not wanting to satisfy my needs.

So here we are, I have a hall pass (that I would prefer not to use) and I have no idea how to use that hall pass.  And by contrast I think my mental health will degrade without physical intimacy.

I legit have no idea where to go from here.  My apologies if this post is not appropriate for this sub, if someone can message me a more appropriate sub I can take this down right away."
wqsrof,I don't know if I can ever talk to my brother again,My fiance (21F) was super stoned and drunk and slept downstairs and my brother (18M) and he fucked her. I don't believe that she was able to consent because of her imparedness. Am I right is it his fault? My family says it wasn't his fault and i should forgive him.
xtr27j,"My 13 year old wants to have sex, help!","She told my wife and I that she‚Äôs ready to have sex and wants us to get her pills and protection. She said she‚Äôs doing it whether we want her to, so she just hopes we‚Äôll give the the resources to be safe. I am on the fence because she‚Äôs too young for sex. My wife thinks we should do it so she doesn‚Äôt get pregnant. I don‚Äôt want to send a message that sex is ok, but I also don‚Äôt want her with an STD or pregnant"
wpj4yg,(30) My friends say my wife (55) groomed me,"Back when I was 18, I didn't have enough money to go to college. I also failed to get scholarships, since I was mostly average. I thought about taking out loans but an older guy in my neighbourhood told me how he still couldn't pay off his loans after five years. Enter Penny, who was 43 at the time.

She's the daughter of the company where my dad worked as a janitor. She's seen me around before since I was a young boy and asked me why I was looking so glum. I told her what was on my mind and she said she'd pay me for sex. I said yes. Somehow it ended up turning into a real relationship after I graduated. She no longer paid me for sex since I became her boyfriend. Few years after I graduated and got a job, we married.

When my wife told my friends how we met, they all accuse her of having groomed me. How do I get them to stop? Or is it impossible to stop them? Is cutting them off the only choice I've got?"
ot4enx,What should I do about my super loud neighbor that scream masturbates at 2am?,"Didn‚Äôt know where else to put this weird one so it‚Äôs here ig lol.

I can hear so clearly I can tell it‚Äôs just her, before someone asks. I‚Äôm obviously trying to sleep. It feels rude to like, bang on the roof or something. She has as much a right to do her business as anybody but I‚Äôm getting frustrated. I have never heard anybody scream and moan this loud.

mvtrzg,"Living with girlfriend, got promotion (50% raise) to work at the Bay Area. Girlfriend says to look somewhere closer instead since she can't quit her job (she will only do so if I marry her). Should I stay or go?","Basically as the title read...

I really like this girl, I enjoy my time with her.  We have been together for 2 years.  But I am 30 and I don't see myself marrying right now or even having the mentality to look after a child at this moment.  She often brings up the whole ""my time is ticking"" and wants to marry to have a family.  I have always been honest  with her and have told her that I don't know when ill be ready.  She has been hoping I would change and its been 2 years now.  

Now I just got an offer that would put me in the Bay Area and give me substantial increase.  We live about 6 hours away from the location (not too bad?) and in California.  I want to accept the offer, but I know that would mean that she will want to come and would want me to marry her.  I totally understand her reasons.  She has a high paying job, bought a place, and has established herself in the area (her name is known).  I do see that she is coming from a sense of ""security"".  SO I do feel bad for her to drop all that to come with me.  But that is what she is willing to do if I marry her. 

I have also talked to her about just being long distance for a year (each visit one another at least once a month) and I could apply at jobs in SoCal after a year. But she doesn't want that and has told me that it would probably be over if I do that. 

To me this is a Golden Ticket that would put me out there to a bigger network and would also push me further into my career.  But I just don't know what to do.  I can take the Job and marry her, take the job and NOT marry her (and see what happens), or just not take the job.  Any advice?"
rnbygo,my girlfriend has been sending nudes to a guy without me knowing,"I really need help from everybody in this subreddit, we have been dating for 5 months, and I just found out that my girlfriend had been sending nudes to a guy wtf and she has never told me, I just found out because I was facetiming her and she was with her best friend and her friend brought it up, my girlfriend was talking to her friend and said ""omg you still talk to that guy"", and her friend said ""this guy that you sent nudes to?"" I was like HOLD ON what the fuck.

Long story short, she said the guy was feeling horny and she felt like she was forced to, so he asked her for a video of her touching herself and she sent it. She always tells me that she is a virgin and is very innocent, and a good girl but I did not expect to find out like this. She doesn't even send nudes to me so I was really shocked. 

I don't know if that counts as cheating, she said she was trying to ""help him out"" because they are friends, she said she doesn't talk to him anymore because he saved the video and its very awkward. 

Do you guys think this is forgivable? or should I end things with her? like what if there are other things I don't know.."
1fc74gg,My finance assaulted his bff on his bachelor party ,"I don‚Äôt know what to do. My (f28) finance ( m28) Alex has a bff ( Dani 28) since they were 4. She‚Äôs not like the usual Reddit bff. She‚Äôs a lovely sweet person who has never crossed boundaries with Alex or their two other friends Marcus and Daniel. The four are very close. Dani is gay and always was. She is very much a woman but likes to dress in jeans and t shirts and not in any feminine clothing. She is lean tall has short hair and  is just one of the boys in a lot of ways.  
 
This weekend was Alex Bachelor party. All four plus two other of Alex friends went along. It was to a costal town that‚Äôs well know for hosting bachelor and bachelorette parties but there‚Äôs no strip club or anything. They stayed in a b&b and have scuba diving and kayaking planned. First night went ok dinner restaurant and night club and home. Last night was the issue. They did the nightclub and headed back to the house. Marcus and Daniel who are both single brought back two girls from the nightclub and got busy in their bedrooms. The rest were drinking in the living room but things got a bit loud and the two friends started complaining that they didn‚Äôt get to go to a strip club and never got to see t*ts and ass. They were blaming their wives and calling them names. Dani told them to shush as it was ruining the mood and they both thought it would be funny if they saw Dani‚Äôs body naked to make up for it. The thing is Alex joined in and they stripped her. She was screaming loudly and Marcus and Daniel came running and rescued Dani and put her in the a bedroom with the girls and had a fight with the three men. Daniel doesn‚Äôt drink due to a chronic medical condition and the medication he is on. So they packed up and took Dani and the two girls and left the other three. Dani was hysterical and Marcus wanted her to go to the police but she wouldn‚Äôt. She was afraid to go home so they ended up dropping the girls off and taking Dani to her parents which was an hour away. 

Marcus was at my door at 7am this morning and he told me what happened that if he ever sees Alex again he‚Äôs afraid of how things could go. He told me that if he can convince Dani to press charges he will . Then he left . 

Alex returned about 3 this afternoon. He was a ting normally until I told him Marcus has visited. He was very nervous and tried to play down what happened as a joke that got out of hand. I‚Äôm devastated. I heard him out but he knew I wasn‚Äôt accepting what he was saying. I told him Dani may be going to the police and he got very panicked and pale. He said she had him blocked and he wanted to go talk to her. I told him she wasn‚Äôt at her place as she was too afraid he or his ‚Äú buddies‚Äù would turn up there. I asked him to leave and he didn‚Äôt want to go but I insisted. He was crying saying it was a prank that got out of hand.   

I heard him out only as a courtesy to our two year relationship but I‚Äôm done. I don‚Äôt know this man. I don‚Äôt know if I should reach out to Dani or just do nothing. Marcus and I have been in constant contact and he agrees that I have no option but to end things. I don‚Äôt know where to start with cancelling everything as the wedding was in 5 weeks but it seems trivial compared to what Dani is going through right now. Marcus is convinced that Dani is going to the police after talking to her parents so I think Alex is in trouble. I can‚Äôt support him on this. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong as he was drunk and probably had taken other things but this was his friend from age 4 and he did this to her. I‚Äôve not blocked Alex but I‚Äôve not replied or picked up any of his calls. "
tk643z,My dad started to touch me inappropriately,"A week ago he (40m) picked me (15f) up from school and then started to stare at me but at my chest, i told him to focus on the road and he did until he pulled over and put his hand on my thigh and started to go up to my crotch, I got really frightened then he stopped and went back home like nothing happened. I stayed in my room the whole day after that and felt scared whenever i was around him, he later came to me and apologized and said if i ever told anyone it would be my fault if he got in trouble, so i kept shut about it. Then the day after that he did it again but put his hand my t shirt and touched my boobs saying he was giving me a massage, I tried to get away from him and show discomfort but he wouldn‚Äôt let go, i was shaking after that. I don‚Äôt know what to do because everyone sees him as a good man and wouldn‚Äôt believe me"
1kzm0xt,How do I convince my wife to consent to me mowing my parents lawn?,"Wife (40 f) is upset with me (39 m) for planing to mow my parents lawn (74f & 74 M)

My parents 50 years anniversary is June 5.

It will take me 3 hours to drive to parents house, mow lawn, drive back.

Wife and I have been arguing for over 15 hours over the last week about mowing the  lawn for 3 hours.   I'm in too deep.  I'm willing to argue another 30 or 300 hours to mow for 3 hours.

In my wife'a defence she adopted a stray cat and the cat has now left for 5 days.  She wants me home to find the cat 

I did discuss plans to mow parents lawn before cat went missing.  I just want to mow the lawn and be done with it for 6-8 weeks.

Update.  I don't have any more energy to fight about it. I'm bussing instead of driving might take 5 or 6 hours. Hopefully longer.

We have been fighting all morning.  In that time I could have drove mowed and come back.   The endless fight over the lawn is draining time that could be used to find the cat.  

She is trying to call me but I can't hear any audio.  She threw my phone this morning and there is a crack by the volume button.

I'm just depleted and defeated. I need to get away.

Update 2.  Took about 38 minutes to mow lawn including time answering calls to be screamed at.  Catching breath and about to do a little more yard cleaning.

Udate 3. Taking some time. Going to go help parents with one more task.

Earlier in the week I ordered Nightreign for Xbox from best buy.  It gives you a $10 gift card.   I ordered the game from her account (we already have a few gift cards attached to her account) but paid with my card.  Using her account (never a problem in the past) while she is grieving the cat is now going to me more to dump on to the fighting.

Update 4.  Heading home soon to see if she is ready to turn it around. If not I'll stay at my parents or sisters for a while.  I'm nervous about that because I don't think she is any shape to take care of the dog.  Maybe error earlier,parents 49th on the 5th. Hope some of the comments help her see our rediculus this has been.

Update 5.  Might have something to do with her doctors not responding and medications not being renewed.  Tried asking more information about this and what medications are not renewed but she flipped the bird."
14f6u33,I was given an ultimatum,"It is what it sounds like. So basically me (24F) and my boyfriend (27M) have talked about marriage. We have a 19 month old baby together and live together. We have been together for 3 years. 
I am going on a birthday trip with my friends 3 girls, 2 guys. We leave on Thursday. My boyfriend tells me he is going to ask me to not go on the trip. I ask why and he says he has a bad feeling. Now, after he elaborated he was saying our relationship isnt in a good spot for me to be going on vacation‚Ä¶. 

This vacation has been in the works since January. SIX MONTHS. 
So now, he says. Do you want me to tell you what happens if you go and if you dont go. Sure why not. 
He says if you go on this trip I will not marry you. If you do not go on this trip, i was going to propose. He wants to know that I will listen to him and that our relationship is more important. His words. Marriage means a lot to me but I feel like this is a control thing knowing I spent a lot of money and planning to be off work to go. 

Now if this was when I first told him about the trip, he wanted to say this then fine. However, its 2 days before the trip. Idk what to think. What do you guys think?

EDIT: I must add when we talked some more, he said he wants to know I will sacrifice for our relationship. So he purposely waited until the trip was coming up and asked me not to go.

UPDATE: this post has gotten SO much recognition. Im glad thousands of people feel the same way that I do and know I am not tripping and going crazy for the ultimatum he gave me. I did in fact go on the trip. I also did consider not going. This was up until he said even if I don‚Äôt go, that we should go our separate ways. I‚Äôm heartbroken because we have our lives intertwined. We have a child together. And now, I‚Äôm on this trip, miserable but also knowing I would be miserable at home if I stayed. Life is so unfair. Up until this point I have done everything. I‚Äôm tired and overwhelmed. I HATE to be a statistic of being a single mom. That was always my worse fear. I can only blame myself though. Thanks everyone for the love and hate comments.

NOV 2023 UPDATE: Just a quick update since someone ran across this post! We are still together and worked through that issue. I never really got to the depth of what he was feeling but my guess is insecurity and wanting a homebody? Idk. However we did work pass it and are still together. "

qn2oq1,Someone deposited a hefty amount of money to my savings account.,"[Update - November 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qpeqb2/little_update_someone_deposited_a_hefty_amount_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

So yesterday, I saw that someone deposited money to my account. Checking where the money came from, it came from a branch I‚Äôm familiar with, but not near from where I live. A few hours later, I received a text from an unknown number that says, ‚Äúdid you receive the money?‚Äù. I tried texting and calling the number. It did answer my calls but the other end of the line wasn‚Äôt speaking at all. Feels like he was just listening to me. 

I tried calling my bank‚Äôs hotline but they were unable to trace the person since the deposit was done over-the-counter. They told me to call the specific branch where the deposit happened but I can‚Äôt reach the number they gave me. 

I also asked my family and relatives if they‚Äôre familiar with the number but they don‚Äôt recognize it at all. No one also transferred money to me, and only my mom and my previous company knows my bank account number. Also asked my previous employer if they recognize the number, but to no avail.

The money is still sitting in my bank account, and I‚Äôm hoping the deposit gets reversed. But until then, what should I do? The text also makes it very suspicious. The person obviously knows my name, account number, and mobile number‚Ä¶ which is creepy. Help?

EDIT/UPDATE: Just for clarification, I‚Äôve asked tons of people I‚Äôm close with about this and they are as shocked as I am. No one knows about the deposit, or even the mobile number.
And I am not from the US, I‚Äôm from the other side of the world. Friends told me that banks here needed my name and my account number to make a deposit.
Regarding the money, it was deposited in cash over-the-counter, not check, according to the bank customer support. All I can say is it‚Äôs more than a thousand dollars.

I also can‚Äôt call the specific branch yet. I talked to the customer support again and they advised me to call on Monday. (Currently Saturday here) So the case is still open. :-( I just transferred my OWN money to my other bank account, as advised by the people here. So thank you! Will update you all soon once I get in touch with the branch."
affy5k,I might lose my home and my car because of Donald Trump,"The government shutdown has left me working full time unpaid. I am currently searching for a new job to work until Donald Trump makes the government run again. I have no paycheck coming in, and I've missed two of my credit card payments. My car payment is overdue and my car insurance company says if I miss another one they will cancel my policy and I will be without car OR renter's insurance. Since I have missed credit card payments and my car insurance payment, my credit score is up, and my premium will surely fly up next time me policy updates. I have a car lease payment coming up in 6 days and if the government is open by then I still won't have another paycheck ready to pay. I might lose my car if it happens twice. My landlord is very understanding but I made an agreement to pay this months rent next month when I get my paycheck. I have around $215 in my savings and I'm currently using that as gas, food, and utility money. When the government is back up I will have to pay off my missed credit card payments and late fees with the next paycheck, my car and renters insurance and lease, rent plus utilities, and overdraft fees for when my car insurance tried to take $176 out of my checking account when I had less than $100 in it. I have been talking to chase and they said if I'd only called before I missed the payment they might have been able to reschedule the first one but not the second..

In short I think my life is ruined and I just want to cry. Does anyone have advice please

Edit: I guess I should've had more in my savings but this government shutdown isnt my fault. Sorry for bitching on the advice thread I'm in a really bad place right now"
wwip20,He's ignoring our safe word,"He loves oral sex....and I mean love loves it. Giving blow jobs is very new to me, but obviously I want to make my partner happy as he does me. He says I'm amazing at it and all he wants to do is shoot load after load in my mouth. Communication for the most part is really good, we have a safe word when things get too intense for one of us (usually me) and we will even tap out. Before, as soon as I would either say the word or tap out he'd back off instantly. Now, say I start gagging on him, I'll try pulling him out but he grabs my chin, gives me a smack across the face and puts it back inside telling me to go further. I've flat out told him no before and tried turning away or getting up. He spits in my mouth and chokes me telling me how I need to be punished for not listening . He'll slap my face, my breasts, and butt (which I know is normal for alot of guys to do) and he'll downright scare me. Once he's done though, he's back to being my sweet and loving boyfriend....it's almost like a light switch. I know people get really into it when things start getting really passionate. Am I just overreacting, and as my mom tells me should just be grateful that I actually found someone who is willing to be with me?"
10rgs1d,"My 16 year old friend has been sexually texting my 10 year old little sister, how do i go about confronting him about it? (without getting arrested)","Burner account because he follows me on my main. Firstly ill go through how i found out he was texting her. Last week on Friday my sister was sitting on the couch and i had walked up behind her to ask her if she had seen my airpods since i couldn't find them and she has a history of taking them from me and hiding them.

She has the enlarged text on her phone for some reason i dont know, but i saw a text when i started talking to her and asked her where my airpods were but half way through what i was saying, i paused because i saw a text that read ""Have they had the talk with you in health yet"". i was behind her as she was sitting on the couch so thats why i was able to read the text. as i said before, i paused half way through my sentence and asked her who she was texting.

Were going to call this friend Harry because i fucking hate the name Harry. she said with no hesitation, Harry (not actually harry but the dudes name). i honestly was at a loss for words. Harry had been my friend since 4th grade and he only had her number since he went with our family to a water park over the summer and at some point i dont remember why, needed her phone number, i didnt even remember he had it until now. i stuttered saying, ""why is he asking you that?"" while taking her phone from her to read the text. i asked her if she meant my friend Harry and she said ""Yeah"" excitedly. ""Whats wrong"". i tell her to shut up as im scrolling through the texts.

they just kept going. he had been talking to her for at least a week or two. i texted him on her phone while she was still asking me whats wrong and what i was doing. i texted back saying something like ""dinners ready ill text you soon"" and thank fuck she let didnt think twice about it and went on her ipad that was on the coffee table next to the couch. im in my room right now with her phone watching to see if he texts her back. i dont know what to do. from the texts i read while scrolling he was talking to her like he would talk to a woman. sexual texts. i didnt even look at them hard enough to see he was asking her if she knew what ""69 meant"" and ""the joke behind it"". He knows shes 10. My parents arent home and wont be til the morning as i am babysitting her and my other little sister whos 13 while theyre gone. im worried to text them about it cause i dont want to worry them. im telling them whenever i get the chance tmrw but for the time being, what do it do? Do i text him and ask him something? do i confront him in person? I dont know what to do.

&#x200B;

Putting the update here because it was lost in the comments.

UPDATE as of today.

To answer a couple questions, the only reason we were home and not at school is because the school had a major leak of some sort when it snowed, so it was closed the entire week, which is why my parents went on a little vacation where they'd go stay at a hotel for a couple days while i stayed at home babysitting my younger sisters. The middle school and high school were cancelled for the week, i know the highschool had a leak but i dont know about the middle school where she goes, but im assuming a similar situation happened at the middle school so they cancelled school for the week for both schools.

Our parents got home around 11:45am and i had told them i needed to talk to them as soon as possible. I showed them the texts and he had even texted her again asking her why she hadnt been responding to her earlier in the morning. i didnt respond to it. i took her phone for the night and when our parents got home, as soon as i could i told them about it and my dad i can tell you this, would have gone to jail if my mom wasnt there to stop him from leaving the room. he was pissed off more then id ever seen him as i was scrolling threw the texts with them. my mom was more just wondering what we would do at that point.

My dad contacted Harry's dad and told him all of it and rightfully, he was angry too. I mean his dad and my dad had been good friends for a while because of me and Harrys friendship. theyve both agreed to not let it effect their friendship but would still be taking it serious. Harrys parents have spoken to him about it and i have yet to ask if they found anything else on his phone, since they did mention they were going to go through his phone and check out what he had been doing. Scrolling to the start of the texts, he had texted her first on January 21st. so he had been talking to her for a WHILE before i found out. talking to her about very sexual things, things i bet he wouldnt have asked his girlfriend, not saying he had one im just saying if he had one. hes never had one hes about 125 pounds and 5'7. i tower over him. i dont think ive ever seen him have more then a 15 second conversation with a girl. other then my 10 year old little sister.

sorry for the update being almost as long as the whole story, its just so much has been happening but at the same time not to much, were contacting the school and police station tomorrow morning. My sister hasnt thought much of it, thank you to one of you, i couldnt find the comment but it was to tell her that the phone needed to be fixed and that it was being fixed for a couple days so that we'd be able to have it. and yes. all of it had been screenshotted even though it is unable to be deleted. also really didnt expect over 105,000 people to read this. its really helped me through all of it.

EDIT because i forgot to mention this. Yes, he did admit to talking to her first and enguaging in conversation with her. its mainly a parents thing at this point with the police and such."

1e7usn0,My (33F) found screenshots of my daughter (14F) on my husbands (32M) phone from ring camera ,"I looked through my husband‚Äôs photos and found he had screenshotted pictures of my 14 year old daughter (his step daughter) leaving for school.

I‚Äôm trying to convince myself this wasn‚Äôt anything weird, however, this video must be 6 months plus old and she is wearing a more than usual revealing outfit in the video. 

I just don‚Äôt think this is random, he would have had to dig for the video.

He also screenshotted multiple shots from the same video and the time stamps say‚Äôs it was around 3am. 

He and I have a daughter (4F) and I‚Äôm 9 weeks pregnant.

Am I over reacting in thinking the worse? 

This is the first time anything like this has happened.

I‚Äôm devastated. He and I have been together for 5 years but have known each other almost 10.  He is generally a good person (so I thought) and though our relationship isn‚Äôt perfect, we do have more happy moments than not.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Has anyone ever been through something like this?

Edit to add:
I know the video is older than a month. I‚Äôm not sure how old. It was during the day. Either going to school or our community park.

Her outfit was a crop top tshirt, she has plenty of non crop top shirts. 

He screenshotted the video this morning at 3am. I found them when I woke up around 5am. 

I plan to ask him when he wakes up why he has the photos.

They don‚Äôt have any abnormal issues that I have seen, I ask from time to time if she is happy he is part of our lives. She‚Äôs never indicated any bad feelings but she is 14 and hates any boundary setting adult.

sf40mx,My 28 yr old friend is having sex with an 16 year old.,"My good friend of many years is 28. He has sole custody of his 2 young kids since the mother abandoned them. Until now he has always been a good dad and a sensible person. My gf and I hang out with him and his gf a lot. She takes care of his kids and is like a mom to them. 

A few months ago he told me he hooked up with a 16 yr old we work with. I guess he though I would think it was awesome but I told him he was stupid for risking his job, his gf and his kids. I looked it up later and the age consent here is 17 so he could go to jail too.

I left that job and my gf and I continued to hang out with him and his gf and I hoped he wasn‚Äôt still hooking up with that girl. 

Well the restaurant we all worked at was short handed so I agreed to help them out. He and the girl still work there. It is obvious that it is still going on. They were all over each other at work and keep disappearing in the back and he gives her a ride home every night.

My gf wants to tell his gf but I am caught in the middle. He would never forgive me. I know what he‚Äôs doing is wrong but I don‚Äôt want him to lose his job or go to jail or lose his kids. She said we could do it anonymously but I don‚Äôt even know if that would work. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do."
1ijtz3m,My boyfriend‚Äôs dick is too big.,"I know it sounds stupid at first, but my boyfriend‚Äôs dick is genuinely too long. Having sex in most positions hurts too much as I can feel his penis hitting my cervix, and then I am left with stomach cramps after sex. We both are aware of it, but there is only so much we know to do‚Ä¶ we know usually only have sex in doggy as that is the least painful.

Does anyone have any advice they can give? I really would love to enjoy missionary and other positions, but i feel like I am being prodded into my stomach everytime

Edit: Guys i did not expect the comments to be so hilariously informative. Thank you all for all the advice. For some questions that have been asked: he is 8 inches, we do like rough sex, but even with the gentle kind it still hurts. I also am allergic to semen, so after the first round he cannot even re-enter the playground. And a reply also mentioned their partner having endometriosis, and I should probably check that out because it does run in my family

EXTRA EDIT: a lot of the guys in the comments are saying that they are now satisfies with their ‚Äúsmaller/average‚Äù size.. MEN, please dont be ashamed or feel like your size is not enough! A 4 inch can feel as good or even better than an eggplant sized penis, it is mostly about confidence, and how you use it, and not the actual size. "

1eyw3ki,I just had an abortion and my partner removed the condom without telling me. ,"I (24F) recently had an abortion just four days ago. My partner (30M) and I decided to have sex, and I was very clear with him that he needed to use a condom because I‚Äôm extremely fertile. I also told him I was afraid it might hurt, and to his credit, he kept checking in on me during the intercourse for the most part. However, he took the condom off midway without telling me, and I only realized after the fact.

When I brought it up, he acted like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and dismissed my concerns. Now, I‚Äôm left feeling really really bad about the whole situation, especially given what I just went through.

The fact that he was checking in on me and being kind has me conflicted. Am I thinking too deeply about this? How should I approach this situation? Should I bring it up again and confront him?

192u9ly,Sitting next to someone on a flight flying to a scam; what do I say?,"I'm genuinely so anxious about this. An older man next to me is connecting to Thailand to meet a girl he met online. Sounds suspicious, but, totally possible. I have family that met their wife online abroad and all are happy. 

But then he showed me a picture of her 30 year old daughter. It's AI art, I am 100% sure. Like not great AI art. 

He's mentioned not having great vision. It's his first time leaving the country. He didn't even realize the flight was gonna be 14 hours (he said like 5, because of the time change). He joked I burst his bubble when I told him it was like 14. 

I doubt if I say anything he would listen. Maybe I'm wrong. I feel like I should tell him that I find that photo suspicious and just if anything feels off at some point, listen to that instinct. 

Is there a common scam? Is he in serious danger? Should I say anything?

Update:

I talked more with the man and it sounded less suspicious as we talked and more like a green card play than anything. He's never sent her money, he only paid for his flight, not the accommodations, etc.

He wasn't like some old grandpa, he was about 60. Not great with his phone, but not the type to fall for a social security scam level of naive. 

I did point out the red flags I saw and showed him how to download the Bangkok map offline to his phone and write down the embassy number. I also explained some common scams to watch out for. 

His family and friends knew about the trip. 

I jotted down his flight info and got his phone number. I passed on most of the details to the US embassy in Thailand and Human Trafficking tip line. Both acknowledged, but aren't gonna share much more with me. "
nu0yvi,My friends aren't speaking to me for calling the police on my neighbors,"Hello everyone, I am having a moral dilemma and my friends are very upset with me and are refusing to even talk to me.

I woke up at 2 am to screaming coming from upstairs. Furniture being thrown around and a female voice screaming ""Let go of me! Don't touch me!"". A male voice was screaming various profanities and threats. I was very scared and I called the police. The man ended up being hauled off in cuffs and the woman was very upset at the police. Screaming ""It was fine! He didn't do anything!""

I told my friends about it. They've seen these neighbors before so they knew who they were. My neighbors involved in the dispute were not white but I am. My friends told me that I put my non-white neighbors in danger of police brutality and that it was implicit bias that caused me to call the police. They told me that I need to acknowledge my white privilege and apologize to the woman for getting her boyfriend arrested. 

I thought I was doing the right thing. But now I don't know anymore. I feel like a massive piece of shit. I don't know how to get over it."
14znb1j,Should I end a decade long friendship after my friend forced me to call an ambulance?,"I (22F) recently went to visit one of my closest friends from childhood (24F) and her kids (5M and 3F). Important to the story, I am a type 1 diabetic. Typically I am always prepared having insulin with me and glucose tablets or other snacks. However, on this particular day, I had what I can only describe as the travel day from hell. After several switches to my itinerary, I ended up at my friends house very early in the morning, and although I had enough insulin, I had run out of glucose tablets and snacks.

This wouldn‚Äôt normally be too much of an issue, as I could buy more once stores opened later in the morning. However, it got to a point where my blood sugar was running low. And not just a normal low, a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not entirely sure how I‚Äôm still conscious‚Äù low. So, I explained the situation to my friend and asked her if she had any carbs or sugary snacks to get me back up. Ever since we were teenagers, this friend has been very invested in diet culture, and has had various seemingly arbitrary rules surrounding food. One of these involved snacking. As it was early in the morning, she said that in her house they don‚Äôt eat any sugar until noon, and the snack cabinet can‚Äôt be opened until after dinner. She said that if she allowed me to have a snack, it would undermine her parenting and set a bad example for her children. I, despite how horrible I was feeling, did my best to explain that this could very quickly turn into a medical emergency if I wasn‚Äôt able to get my sugar back up. She didn‚Äôt budge, and went as far as standing in her kitchen doorway so that I couldn‚Äôt go in to get anything.

As I was getting very nervous about the situation, I decided arguing with her was pointless, and I called an ambulance. I‚Äôm definitely OK now, the paramedics were able to bring my sugar back up without even having to go to the hospital. Once I felt ok, I first went to the store to stock up on snacks in case this happens again. Then I took my things to a hotel, and ignored any of my friend‚Äôs attempts to contact me. Part of me really wants to end the friendship. Although I recognize that her feelings towards food are partly due to her being absorbed in diet culture, and I feel really bad about that, I don‚Äôt think I can excuse her blatant disregard for my health, especially because it would‚Äôve been such an easy solution on her part to avoid needing an ambulance. One text that she did send me was a sort of ‚Äúapology‚Äù but it was kind of backhanded. It was more of a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry my lifestyle and house rules don‚Äôt align with your needs,‚Äù and that really rubbed me the wrong way.
Should I end our friendship over this? She‚Äôs been a great friend of mine for almost a decade, and I recognize that it was my responsibility to manage my diabetes. Part of me thinks we could remain friends, as long as I don‚Äôt put myself in a position where I need to rely on her for things like this, but another part of me questions why I‚Äôd even bother after this.


UPDATE: I received an apology from her tonight. She originally texted, asking if I was ok to talk, and saying she understood if I didn‚Äôt want to. She did allow me vent my frustration and confusion without interrupting, and then we talked for a really long time. Ultimately she said (I should note that I was really looking for some explanation or closure because I couldn‚Äôt understand how this happened, and I made that clear to her) that she didn‚Äôt realize how dangerous it was, that she assumed in an emergency I would ‚Äúlook sicker,‚Äù and assumed that my anxiety and the long travel day were causing me to feel worse, so she didn‚Äôt register the urgency. She said she had simply been fed up with her kids asking about snacks recently, so she was so focused on not bringing that upon herself that day. After her talk with the paramedics (which was apparently far more harsh and brutally honest than I realized, but I do think justified), she did realize what happened, and admitted in her own words that she was ‚Äúso hardheaded that I didn‚Äôt think you dying was a real option‚Äù. She acknowledged that her texts and actions were wrong, and promised to educate herself more, and to take my word for it in the future if I needed anything. While it did come across as fairly genuine, I basically let her know that I‚Äôd need some time, and that I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôd be able to have the same relationship we had in the past, but that I‚Äôd think on it. She understood, so at the very least if it ends, this friendship ended on a civil note. I really appreciate everyone‚Äôs advice, and just allowing me to work through this and try to process  this. I‚Äôve definitely learned a lot about myself, and my people pleasing tendencies through this, so some self reflection is definitely needed on my end before moving forward.


UPDATE 2: for those wondering about the ambulance bill, and/or any type of legal action, I didn‚Äôt bring it up with her and I really don‚Äôt plan to. Even though I understand where this is coming from, I can‚Äôt in good conscience ask her to do that. And that‚Äôs not even necessarily for her sake, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in a much better position financially, and especially for the sake of those kids I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. They‚Äôre a single income household, and her husband makes about the same amount of money that I do, if not less. He is using that income to support a family of 4, and I know they‚Äôre struggling, whereas I‚Äôm splitting bills with my fianc√©. Even if I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way, it would just make me feel guilty and her paying for it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily make me feel any better about the situation."
nh11lp,"Girlfriend wants to ""hang out"" with new friend....well new to me...","Quick info. We have been together for about 10 years. We have a son who is 7. Pretty stable relationship and a pretty solid foundation of trust. I'm 35, she's 34. We are not married. No known issues with cheating before.

So yesterday my GF comes home from work and we are talking about our plans for the weekend. We like to hike and camp on the weekends and had made plans to go this weekend with our mutual friends for a fun filled kid free weekend in the Indiana backcountry.

She asks me if our plans are ""solid"".

""Well yeah, I already locked on a baby sitter and we made plans with our friends, so yeah pretty locked in I guess. Why what's up? Do you need to work or something?"" I say trying to be supportive of her job that is very time consuming for her.

She tells me she has a ""friend"" from out of town coming in this weekend she just found out about and wanted to have a meet up, to which and invite was never extended not me, which is odd in itself. 

I name off her out of state friends and she tells me it's a guy Nick she meet while her friends were getting married in Florida. A wedding I was not able to attend. She never mentioned this guy once since the wedding. I have never met this person I don't know this person at all. We know all of each other's friends. It's not uncommon for us to hang out with the opposite sex like I said we have a stable trustworthy relationship. But when I told her I though we had plans she seemed very torn on breaking those plans to meet up with this new friend Nick. 

I don't mind going by myself, I enjoy it. I even told her she was free to go if she wanted as I'm not the jealous type. But all the red flags popped up on this one. She never talked about him, it's a friend of a friend she got to hang out with for a week alone with in Florida during a wedding, and she is willing to break plans with me and our other couple we planned to go with just to see this guy again. 

Maybe I'm overreacting, but it seems really weird to me. Looking for advice, what should I do here? Should I feel like anything is going on that shouldn't be?

Sorry for any typos. typing from my phone. Edits for details



**Update**

Ok so first off wow. This really took off. I appreciate all the advice given here in the last 24 hours. I tried to address as many questions as I could and at some point it just was not possible. But I did read alot of them. I wanted to address some things that came up.

Marriage is not a magical end all be all for a relationship. Married men and women cheat at almost the same statistical rate as non married people. I've never been a fan of it. When we first started dating I made my feelings on this known and never hid this from her. She feels the same way about this. We also both agreed if it became a bigger issue we would revisit the topic at a later date. Our commitment isn't suddenly going to be stronger because we bought and overpriced rock on a gold band. Different strokes people.

Some of you asked or talked about her having friends and being able to have friends with out my permission. This is not a thing in this relationship. She is free to choose her friends and the same goes for me. However I do still think it's fair that if one of them makes either of us uncomfortable we are allowed to have a conversation about it and we have and adjusted accordingly.

Yes, we ask each other ""Hey is it ok if I go hang out with so and so tonight?"" as a respect thing. It's not for permission. Normally that means the other will need to stay home and watch the kid if we can't find a babysitter or we want to make sure the other didn't have plans to spend that time together. IMO this is a pretty healthy normal thing.

As for last night I did confront her about my feelings and the issue at hand. Her reaction did tell me alot. Had she been defensive and off put that would have given me cause for alarm instead she was visibility upset about how I felt and that I could feel that way towards her after this long. She said herself ""You have never acted this way once in our relationship."" And she is right. I knew this could be an outcome and it's one that although I wanted to avoid, that nagging feeling would not go away. She explained that this was her friends best friend and they became friends through a mutual love of picking on her friend that was married as friends do. She never brought him up because like many of you said he wasn't that big of a deal in the scope of the wedding and all that went on that week. 

I had a choice to make, given the information I was had and what she gave me through words and emotions. I could either continue down a path of mistrust or accept I had made a mistake and move forward. I do trust her, that doesn't mean I can never have doubts. I think it does mean that when she looks me in the eyes and tells me ""nothing happened and nothing would happen."" I have to take that as truth and I do. 

I will be meeting Nick this weekend. Although our talk did alot for me, meeting this person and gauging his reaction and interaction with her will, in my mind, put the issue to bed. 

I do think I had valid issues, but even then that doesn't make me correct in my assessment of the situation with the limited info I had about this person and their relationship. An apology from me to her is the most likely end result and we will continue to work on ourselves and our relationship. 

Thanks again for all the advice, and even to the few of you who's advice was so outlandish it made me laugh while feeling upset in my own life. Good luck to all of you. I guess the moral here is it's ok to feel one way about something but even if you feel some way about it give them the opportunity to explain. Stay calm and talk about it. If you love the person then it's worth it."
164428o,What should I do? My (f15) brother (m12) threw away my box of tampons bcuz he thinks it's gross.,"I'm a 15 year old girl and like most of the female species, I have periods. I usually keep a box of tampons in the bathroom closet and recently, my 12 year old brother found them and threw them away. When I asked my family about what happened to them, my brother admitted to doing this because he thinks it's ""gross"" and ""unsanitary"". These are unused tampons, still in the package. It's not like they've already been used. I talked to my mom about this and she seemed to be on my brother's side. Should I start hiding them? I feel like what my brother did was really unnecessary and rude, or that he's faking being grossed out to get me in trouble."
1cadhk0,Husband told me I'm putting lipstick on a pig,"I'm 2 weeks post partum and still have 20/25lbs to lose. I'm 5'10 and 195lbs. Usually around 170/175. I decided to get a spray tan to make myself feel a little less like a marshmallow and asked my husband to watch the baby for an hour so I could go. He asked why I'm even going since its just like putting lipstick on a pig and my real issue is not being tan,  its the extra weight. I normally spray tan, but stopped during pregnancy. I told him his comment was rude and he disagreed saying I'm being too sensitive and it's just a fact. He also used this reference the week before when I was putting on makeup and asked me the same question. I'm really pissed off at him and not sure how to respond. Looking for ideas to either understand his perspective or how to properly communicate this is not a nice thing to say. "
xzwznx,Wife Had a Threesome,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point. My wife(39f) and I(43m) have been together 19 years, married for the last 10. For about the past year or so we've been fantasizing and talking about having a threesome. She's always been attracted to women so we always discussed another woman being involved with the two of us. Last weekend she went to hang out with a coworker she hangs with regularly. She got home after I went bed which is completely normal. The next day while I'm working she text me that stuff happened with her friend and her friend's husband. She promises there was no penetration of any kind (except fingers) by the husband but everything else you can think of took place. Neither of us has ever had a threesome prior to this and I'm pretty upset that her first experience was with another man! How concerned should I be here?

Edit: Never posted anything to reddit and definitely didn't think so many would respond. I feel I need to answer a few commonly asked questions real quick and give a quick update as to where we are.
Yes, we have 3 kids, 24, 15 and 8. 1 granddaughter and another on the way. We also have everything else you'd expect from building a life together, a mortgage, car payments, shared health insurance, etc.
Yes, this post is a real situation that I'm living 
No, I'm not a cuck
I truly appreciate everyone's feedback and advice, especially those that thought about all the variables that come with almost 2 decades together! This shit happened a little over a week ago and all we've done is talk and fuck. The talking gets heated on my end most the time. She has been extremely apologetic and the part of me that married my best friend wants to believe that this was a one time fuck up. She knows she fucked up...BAD! I'd like to hope if the roles were reversed, she would afford me some leniency. One comment addressed that couples that want to add others to the mix need clear cut rules, we didn't have those whatsoever. What she did is most certainly cheating! I know the majority that offered advice are gonna say I'm a simp or setting myself up to have this happen again, but I'm leaning towards taking that chance because we have so much more than time invested in each other. We love each other's family members and I can't imagine how many people would be devastated by our separation. I was 15 when my parents divorced, it fucked me up. Dropped out of school, got arrested a few times, did way more drugs than a 15 year old should even be able to get! I couldn't forgive myself if our kids spiraled downward because of this!"
11r6x69,I Think My Husband Could Be Plotting To Kill Me,"TL;DR Discovered my husband has for a while been telling people I'm suicidal, and am generally mentally unstable. It's occured to me this could be part of an attempt to make it look like I commited suicide if I were to die suddenly. Am I being paranoid?

I (26f) Have recently found reason to suggest my husband (29M) could be plotting to kill me and make it look like a suicide.

Yes, I realise how out there that sound, let me explain-

My reason for thinking is is because I discovered he has been secretly telling people we know, for a while, that I am apparently suicidal, along with other things to make me seem mentally unstable, as far as lying about having to call the police because I was a missing person. Recently the thought came to my mind, that this could be a way of making my death appear like a suicide, if he were to kill me, and I wanna share those thoughts to see what others think 

It started after he one night told me not to go into the local store he works at, as he left early and had apparently used me as an excuse. Then not long after he happened to leave his messages open, and I noticed a conversation with his coworker about me, so curiosity got the better and I took a snoop. Turns out the excuse he'd used about me, was claiming that I'd gone missing and he needed to go look for me, adding the detail that I'm 'on suicide watch' even saying that he called the police. 
   
On another occasion, he said we can no longer go to his shop on Thursdays (It's the local store so we shop there regularly) because he'd told them he needed that day off as he takes me to therapy that day (This isn't true, we've never been to therapy)  

More recently we had similar incident, where he told me I couldn't go in the his shop as he'd used me as an excuse again. I Took another snoop and found he'd told them he needed to stay home with me due to my mental health. When he finally went back he told them that my brother is able to be with me now so he feels safe leaving me at home (I Haven't spoken to my brother in months)

To be clear, I have no history of mental health issues, never had to go to therapy, never been a missing person, nor has anyone ever had to call the police for me

This all also reminded me of a time a while ago, where he mentioned in casual conversation how he could get away with killing me, because no one would notice me missing. He explained how I don't talk to my friends or family regularly so they wouldn't realise I was gone, and he could just call my work and tell them I quit. This did creep me out at the time, but I brushed it off as a weird joke

For background, my husband is diagnosed with autism,  ADHD, and narcissistic personality disorder, he also has always had compulsive lying and anger issue. (I've Know of that since even before this) He also has a history of mistreating me, in a way some might call abusive. A lot of emotional abuse such as putting me down, both privately and in front of other,  being demanding and controling. He's never actually struck me physically, but has used threats of violence to get what he wants before

Although all this concerns me, I also feel kinda silly for being concerned. Maybe I'm just paranoid, maybe I actually am as crazy as he's making me out to be? An outside perspective would be helpful.

Should I do anything, or just ignore it and stop snooping?

[EDIT: Apologies for the way I've been replying to comments so far, I realise I've been acting kinda stubborn and it isn't helpful. I'm Gonna pause reading the comments for a bit so I can come back with a more clear head. Please do continue commenting if you have anything though as I will read them]

[UPDATE: (21/3/2023) I Have spoken to the council who say they will be able to provide me with emergency accommodation, I am currently making plans and waiting for an opportune time to leave]"
un6ylp,Would it be weird to have have period pads?,"I (17M) am thinking of buying pads for period, for emergency. now, I do not have a girlfriend or any reason to buy them other for just in case randomly I hear that a girl needs one and and can't find one, so I'll have like 2 in my bag at all times for the sake of having them, cause I know most girls have them and i think it would be nice for some guys out there to have them.
Would it be weird? Am I thinking right? Should I buy them?
For the record if I get them I'll get like a very general fit cause everyone is different as you know.
TL;DR: I (17M) thinking of buying pads for period in case of an emergency and I don't know if it'll be weird.

Edit: Thank you all for the responses and the kind words, I've baught them and when I get home I'll put 2 in my bag :)
Edit 2: For those of you who wonder what the situation would be like: (overheating a girl she needs one an has asked her fellow women and none of them happened to have one), me going quitely to the girl and telling her respectfully and again quitely that i have one if she wants and she is more than welcome to decline my offer if she's not comfortable with it.
And for those who think it's coming from a thirsty mind, it's not. How would I even go from giving them a pad to coming on to her?!"
w3xqqt,Daughter acting strangely,"My (33M) 12 year old daughter has been acting in a very strange way for a while now. A little background info, we live alone. Her mom left when she was 3 months old and we both haven't seen her since. So, about a week ago I came home from work and she was just sitting on the couch staring at me. Like always, I asked her how her day was but she didn't answer back. Then, I asked her if anything was wrong since she usually is very cheerful and happy when I come home from work. She just shook her head no and went up to her room. I went to the bathroom afterwards and saw the floor had soap or shampoo all over it, literally ALL over. I was obviously confused as to why that would happen, so I called her down to ask her. When I inquired about it, she smirked and mumbled something under her breath which i couldn't make out. I asked her in a firmer voice to explain what happened but this time she ignored me and walked up to her room. I was very puzzled but I told her she had to either clean it or I would ground her. She has never done anything like this before so I was perplexed.. Another incident happened this morning at breakfast. We were both in the kitchen, I was making pancakes as she requested, and she was pouring water. Oddly, she kept pouring water and didn't stop. I only realised when I heard water dripping. I told her to be careful, she was spilling water all over the floor, but she didn't react. I thought maybe she couldn't hear me so I said the same thing louder but she still didn't react. I had to come over and remove the glass from her hand. After that she just went to the yard and sat on the grass. I tried talking to her and asked her what was wrong but she burst into tears and ran into her room and locked the door. She refused to come out for hours and I didn't want to scare her in any way by forcing her to come out. About 2 hours ago she finally left her room and gave me a hug. I'm really confused, why is she acting like this? I dont want things to become worse so I felt it'd be best to stop whatever is wrong as early as possible. There aren't any school bullies or anything since she's homeschooled, and she sees friends everyday in the summer and she hasn't had any fights with any of them as far as I know. No online weirdos either since I always monitor her smartphone usage. I have no idea why she could be acting like this and it's really beginning to scare me.. Any ideas what can be wrong and how i can help her? 

P.S: Sorry for bad English, not my first language...


EDIT: Thank you all so much for your advice! I've made an appointment with a neurologist later today and I will be taking her to a therapist. I will be updating you guys on what happens.

A lot of people have been asking how her homeschooling works. She attends online school which is on zoom and has private tutors which come by our house 3 times a week to address any issues she may have. When she has tutors over, I never let them out of my sight (they sit at the counter and I sit opposite of them and just finish up paperwork) so her tutors aren't SAing her or anything. 
Also, I am not forcing her to be homeschooled, in fact, she refuses to attend in-person school. When she was 5 years old, I took her to school and it was her first day. At first, she was very excited to go but as soon as we arrived she started crying and refused to leave her car seat. I felt bad but I had to force her out of it as I had work and nowhere to leave her. When I came to pick her up I was informed she was STILL crying (7 hours). She was sitting in the corner just sobbing and from that day onwards I decided it would be best if she was homeschooled. It broke my heart seeing her like that. fast forward to when she turned 9 (4th grade), I recommended she go back to in-person school but she aggressively denied my suggestion. I obviously am not going to force my daughter to do something she doesn't feel comfortable doing since it's only going to make things worse. She has plenty of social interaction with friends and cousins her age. However, I'll check with her if she feels comfortable going back to in-person school now.


UPDATE: I took my daughter to a neurologist who thankfully assured us that nothing is wrong with her physiologically (no absence seizures, epilepsy, etc) but recommended I take her to a psychiatrist when I told him about what has been happening recently. Her psychiatrist appointment is tomorrow morning and I'm really looking forward to finding the root cause of her recent concerning behaviour. 
I asked her if she feels comfortable going back to in-person school and said she'd think about it which made me really happy since before, whenever I'd mention in-person school, she would get very defensive and upset. I also made it known to her that I'm always here for her if she ever wants to talk about anything, and that I'd never judge her or criticise her. She told me she knows that and that she loves me.
She seems to be looking forward to going to the psychiatrist (she wasn't too happy about the neurologist but I assured her it was for her own wellbeing). God, I feel incredibly relieved that she doesn't have seizures. Thank you all so much for the support. Will update after the psychiatrist visit.


Psychiatrist update: Sooo as it turns out, my daughter started her first period. When we got to the psychiatrists office my daughter requested I wait outside after we finish talking about what happened because she wanted to tell the psychiatrist something. I'm glad she did. Basically the psychiatrist told me everything, the soap was because she was dripping blood everywhere when she was freaking out about the blood. She knew a little about periods but freaked out because for some reason the blood was brown. My poor baby said she stayed up for days worrying about how I'd feel once she passes away (god forbid) and the water incident happened because she felt something ""drop"" down there which I assume is more blood. I feel bad about how I missed this and I wonder how she hid it so well. My sister is now in the other room talking to her about periods, how to deal with them, the feelings associated with menstruation, etc.. I'm incredibly glad it's nothing serious like seizures, epilepsy, etc. My daughter seems to be way happier now and I'm loving it. We (along her with aunt) went to get her a period starter kit after the appointment and she seemed really excited. After that we all went to get milkshakes and just chilled for a bit. Everything is great now. Thank you guys so much from the bottom of my heart for everything. ‚ù§ 

Forgot to mention; she's decided to go back to in-person school which I'm over the moon about! :)"
1bggy1g,"shook hands after sex, i gave him a thumbs up ",wheeeee
16iveup,My wife got upset when I changed my daughter‚Äôs diaper,"This is honestly so weird that I even have to ask this but I don‚Äôt know where to go with this 

My wife is a SAHM. We have a 5 week old daughter. My wife was putting on her clothes after showering and our daughter pooped so I brought her to the changing table and my wife yelled to the other room so I can hear her ‚ÄúI‚Äôll change her diaper now just give me a sec‚Äù and I was already starting to change her diaper and my wife was like ‚Äúnooooo let me do it‚Äù and I said I‚Äôm already changing her it‚Äôs okay and she said ‚Äúno it‚Äôs weird‚Äù and she told me I‚Äôm making her uncomfortable so I stopped I didn‚Äôt wanna keep upsetting her and I let my wife change her diaper. She apologized after our daughter was changed and she basically told me that she doesn‚Äôt think any man should be around female naked babies even if you‚Äôre the father 

This is really strange I know it‚Äôs hard not to feel offended by this as a father. My wife has trauma in the past from this. When my wife was age 7-13 years old her father‚Äôs sister‚Äôs husband use to stick his hands down her pants and feel her around. He didn‚Äôt stick his fingers inside her she said but she would touch her and move his hands around in her pants and rub her genitals with his hands and I know for a fact this is why my wife is freaked out. I know she knows it‚Äôs not me she‚Äôs worried about. This is something that triggered her brain from the sexual abuse for many years. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. She‚Äôs also been to therapy for this for many years.. she started going to therapy since she was in high school

Edit: wow I didn‚Äôt know this was gonna blow up. I couldn‚Äôt read everything but I read the top comments. As I‚Äôve mentioned she‚Äôs been in therapy since high school. Everyone is recommending changing therapists‚Ä¶ she has been through 3 different therapists. Im sorry if I offend anyone but I don‚Äôt believe she can magically be cured from a traumatic event in her life that lasted most of her childhood‚Ä¶ she has seen so much help. This is something very traumatic that happened to her. I‚Äôm honestly just gonna try to do anything that‚Äôll make her more comfortable that‚Äôs the easiest thing I can do to ease her pain‚Ä¶.  This is our first and last baby"
we744w,My husband wants to have sex with his coworker,"This is a long story but I will try and keep it as short as possible.

My husband and I have been together 10 years. A very happy marriage. Recently he told me he had constant thoughts about wanting to have sex with his coworker who (according to him) has a boyfriend of 6 years. And he asked me if I could give him permission to have sex with her. This was very hard for me to hear because am not ok with him having sex with another woman but also because he was about to go on a business trip with her. Just the 2 of them. On the 1st day of his trip they did alot of things together (which is fine) but come to find out, he invited her into his room to watch a show together. When he got home we had many arguments about this and I asked why he was so sure he could ask her to have sex without her being livid or getting fired, to which he replied because he believes the feeling is mutual and that there is sexual tenssion on her side as well. Again, lots of fighting, but in the end he agreed to boundries with this person, mostly not bring in a hotel room together.Fast forward a couple weeks, he had another trip with this woman. When he gets there, his room was canceled. I called him when he was at dinner with this girl and asked if he found a room to which he said no he hadn't found a room and he didn't know what he was going to do. Come to find out that was a lie that I caught him in. He did sleep in the same room as this woman but claimed that he had a cot that he slept on. Now, he is telling me he doesn't want boundaries with her. Only that he won't ever cheat on me..so anything else should be ok. I feel this isn't ok.  I guess I am wondering if I am being unreasonable. If he doesn't cheat, does that mean that this should be ok?

&#x200B;

lets say, for arguments sake, that I believe he hasn't cheated and that I believe him when he says he never will.... am I crazy for thinking that there should still be boundries here. Even IF he hasn't cheated on me with her? This is where  he is making me feel like I am crazy for asking for boundries.

**Update**  in case my update didn't show below...I took the woman out for lunch because at the time my husband said it would help me to see that she is a ""good person"" and that there was nothing going on between them. So I took her to lunch and paid for it and apologized to her. She acted like she had no idea. (She did I later found out). My husband admitted to kissing her and holding her hand back to the hotel. He says that's all that happened. That after the kiss he immidiatly regretted it. He says that absolutely nothing happened on that next trip where he slept in her hotel room for a night because his room wasn't booked for that particular night. So she came to his rescue üôÑ I called her and she Denies everything. Says nothing ever happened between them. Not sure why my husband would lie about cheating.

**Update** 
 I have gotten 8 different versions of his ""truth"". After every new version, I attempt to cope. Then he admits to something else. I cope. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

The most up to date version is that everyone was right. He had sex with her on both trips they went on.  The full version was told to me about 2 months ago. I am not even sure if that is really all, or not... But to be honest, it doesn't matter at this point. I don't trust anything anymore. I forgave him. I finally got to the point where being angry was only hurting me... Not him... Not her. Just me. I don't feel anger towards him anymore. Now we are in the ""let's see what happens"" phase. I know alot of people will crucify me for not divorcing. It's not that easy for me. He was the love of my life for all these years. I never trusted anyone in my whole life (besides my mom) the way that I trusted him. He is the father of my 3 kids. The realities of my marriage feel shaken and I want to make sure I have done absolutely everything to save it before I throw in the towel."
y2bnqs,My dad did something I don‚Äôt think I can forgive. HELP,"I am a 15 y/o male and my dads is in his late 30s. Please forgive me for any grammar errors. 

Last night I came home later than curfew because the busses where late on construction my dad was upset and told me so, when I got home he was knocked out on the couch. I fell asleep shortly after. 

I woke up to him telling me to get up for school, I reminded him that I had to go to court and it started at 12:00pm my school starts at 9:00am meaning that I‚Äôd only be in school for three hours. My father is a busy guy he owns a business in which profits nose dive in the winter he is incredibly irritable when this happens. 

I told him that because of the timing of the court date that him picking me up at school 3 hours after getting there is a bad idea and ‚Äúis inconvenient and a waste of time ‚Äú because again he is very busy and needs all the time he can get.

He told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to tell me about bad ideas? You‚Äôre making me loose money because of your decisions‚Äù and he started to talk down to me.

He started to get incredibly mean and personal with his talking. 

This is where I‚Äôll acknowledge my part in stuff I told him that he was being a dickhead and being mean to me because he was stressed. I shouldn‚Äôt have sworn and I‚Äôll take that .

He got very close and started to yell in my face I started swearing more and he got very upset he pushed me and I swore at him and I think I pushed him back. I definitely did not strike or attempt to strike him.

He then grabbed me I tried to get away and told him to get off he kept on going I was not being very hard and he eventually got me on the ground.

He then placed his knee my throat and put my arm into the air he applied pressure to my throat I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

As I was laying there my mind was in shock, disappointment, sadness, and anger. 

I couldn‚Äôt breathe my throat hurt and I felt like I was going to pass out I kept trying to tell him to get off , that I couldn‚Äôt breathe,that he was hurting me. 

Eventually he let off I still couldn‚Äôt breathe for a second and started crying and coughing. After maybe 30 seconds I recovered and went to him in the kitchen with his wife (my stepmom). I was crying and screaming at my dad and his wife was talking to me I screamed ‚ÄúHE PUT HIS KNEE ON MY **** NECK‚Äù  she asked me how long it took for me to calm down , this had all taken place in a couple minutes. We all somehow ended up at the back of the house I was still crying and yelling when my dad started getting close and pushing again . 

This is where I‚Äôll admit my second mistake I punched him in the face because I got scared. 
I was in the corner of the room and couldn‚Äôt get away.

He then punched me in the face maybe twice and punch me again somewhere else I don‚Äôt remember where We wrestled again and then ended up on the floor where he let me go again and I walked out of the house.

I walked around the neighborhood and And came back recording to get myself a outfit for the court. I have the video. 

I had recently moved in recently being in the last couple of months and I‚Äôm now at my mom‚Äôs house had time to gather myself and think and I‚Äôm disappointed and angry and I‚Äôm sad.

I do not want the police or CPS to be involved but I don‚Äôt know what to do I‚Äôm thinking about just not talking to him."
1gncnro,"I (31F) am considering a divorce with my husband (33M) while he's in a psychiatric hospital, but don't know if it's the right thing to do","I know it sounds absolutely terrible, but I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I made some posts about my husband's odd behavior regarding our daughter (6 now, 5 at the time) and her artwork. To sum things up, he was destroying/throwing away the art she was making, without telling me, and lying about it. I had confronted him about it, but he got defensive and went so far as to break our art supplies afterwards. 

I dropped off our daughter with my mom before trying to talk to him again, since I was nervous, honestly. I didn't know what he'd do. It's been over a year since then at this point, but basically, I told him that I was worried. That he was acting really erratic, and that I really thought he should try and get some help. And... he agreed. I was so relieved, and we talked about getting in touch with a therapist, trying to figure out why he was so against the art. He told me at the time that he didn't know why it bothered him, but I'm not really sure if he was lying or not. 

Things were fine for a couple weeks, with him leaving and going to therapy, and our daughter being happy and fine. Honestly, I thought that was the end of it. That he had some issue, but was working on it. Except I was completely wrong. I got home one night after being out with some friends, and he told me that he didn't feel comfortable being around our daughter. I was absolutely taken off guard, because I thought he was doing better, and moreso i didn't think it was this big of a deal. Not to the point of being worried about safety. Looking back, it wasn't the right choice, but I begged him not to go. It didn't matter anyway, he packed up some clothes, and left after checking on our daughter who was asleep. I was crushed. He didn't even wait until morning to say a proper goodbye to her, and this whole thing just came out of the blue.

He drove a couple hours away to a hospital closer to where his family lived, and admitted himself. I felt just so numb and confused, because obviously I would support him no matter what, but this felt like such a rapid escalation that I just didn't know how to handle. 

And that's basically where we are now. It's basically been a little over a year, and he's still there. There was one hell of an adjustment period, but I promised him that I was there for him no matter what. That I still love him, that I'm proud of him for working on himself. And I mean all that, I really do. But things just aren't getting better. At first we spoke most days, either on just the phone or on video call. But it got less and less, until now where he maybe calls me once a week. Our daughter has adjusted so well, but I think she's getting a sense of permanence about it all, and I can't say I blame her. It's feeling pretty permanent to me, too. 

I don't even know truthfully *why* he's still there. Not that I knew why he went in the first place. I ask him about it, but he gets weird and dodgy, and I just can't bring myself to fight it. He's got a right to privacy, but at the same time, I'm his wife! I wish I wasn't quite as much a pacifist. 

Recently, I was talking with my BIL, who's one of my only inlaws who still really talks to me. My MIL basically doesn't say a word to me, even when I reach out. Sometimes she'll ask about my daughter, but it's just... depressingly silent. But BIL still acts like i'm family, which I am. And he came over recently, and we were talking. And he mentioned that he visited my husband. 

I was utterly speechless. My husband hasn't let me or our daughter visit. I understand that a brother is different, but still, I'm his wife. I just don't really know what to do about it. BIL said that my husband seems to be doing better, seems happier, but I don't know what to believe anymore. My husband still refuses to give any sort of timeline on how long he's planning to stay in the hospital, and I'm at the end of my rope. 

I promised that I'd love and support him, but I just feel so alone. I feel like he doesn't really talk to me anymore, let alone *love me*. And honestly, my daughter seems just as happy as she was before, if not happier. She gets upset about her daddy sometimes, but most of the time it's almost like she's forgotten about him. I used to try and make sure she still felt connected, still felt like her daddy was a part of her life, but as of late it's just... hard to feel right doing so. The man barely talks to us anymore. 

I don't want to be married anymore. Not like this. I feel like scum even thinking about it, but I just can't imagine ever returning to normal after this. I basically haven't known what's going on with my husband for over a year now, and I've never felt so alone in my entire life. And I can't help but feel like maybe if I just... end things, that I might be able to start feeling okay again.

Am I being stupid? Should I keep trying to push through this with my husband, or am I maybe in the right for at least exploring the option of divorce? I don't know what to do, and could really use some advice about all this. "
jugmqe,Cat breeder wants cat back?,"I purchased a kitten a week ago from a breeder, and a few days ago I asked her if it was common for the breed to be needy/clingy. The kitten is so sweet and cute, but if I am cooking, showering, eating (basically anything I can‚Äôt focus on him about) he is at my ankles screaming. I have raised multiple cats and kittens and this is the first time I‚Äôve had this issue. I have all types of toys for him and play with him during the day (minus when I am working). I give him as much attention as possible, and I have a second cat that he plays well with.

The breeder sent me an email back saying that in her over-a-decade experience she has never had someone ask her that or tell her that and if I wanted a more independent cat I shouldn‚Äôt have chosen this breed. She told me I can give him back so he can be ‚Äúaround people who understand and love him‚Äù and that she will give me my money back. I was shocked and horrified. 

I told her I love him very much and so does my other cat, and that I am not interested in returning him, I just wanted tips for raising him. She told me again that I should return him and that the only tip she had for me is to give him the love and attention he deserves. She said giving him back will be better for the kitten.

I am shocked at how unprofessional this seems. I also do not want to give him back, I love him! 

I told her again that I love him and am not interested in giving him back. I am hoping she does not email again, but at this point she seems sort of crazy to me. What should I do if she keeps emailing me?

Edits:

The kitten is healthy and from a good breeder. He has already been checked by a vet. He uses his litter box and eats well. This seemed to be a concern for some.

I got a kitten from a breeder and not from a shelter because I wanted to make sure I would be receiving a cat that does not have health problems. I have adopted before and unfortunately a lot of shelter cats have health issues due to being on the street or living rough lives. I live alone and go to grad school while working full time, so that wasn‚Äôt a reasonable option for me financially or time-wise. I wanted a cat where I knew what it‚Äôs personality would probably be like when it was older.


Thanks everyone for your responses!

I told the breeder I am not interested in letting him go, and provided a picture of him asleep with my other cat. She said she was glad he has a friend."
tr0fui,my boyfriend had sex with me as i slept.,"We've been dating 4 months, for the most part things are going fine. He can be a little controlling but nothing to crazy. On Monday nights he picks me up from work drives me home and we hang out until he has to go to work at 3 am that night. Last night at around 2 am I woke up to being fucked. I was so confused but I thought maybe I was awake when we started but fell asleep halfway through from exhaustion, only to wake up later. But I asked him. And he said he started when I was asleep. I asked him to please never do that again, and he said he wouldn't. But I feel so uncomfortable. I don't understand why he would want to fuck a limp body. I know this isn't normal and it wasn't right, but besides that this is my most successful relationship to date. I'm wondering if I should question this relationship."

1kelzrf,New wife doesn‚Äôt like my daughter,"I've been with my wife for about 5 years now since my kid was 10. My daughter is now 15 and not doing well in school , she's failing a few classes and can get an attitude at times.  When she doesn't have an attitude she's friendly and she is passing some classes with As and Bs like Math, biology, and band. She just doesn't like PE and Spanish.  I've tried restricting her phone and giving her money incentives for raising her grades but nothing has worked.  My new wife absolutely disilikes her and has indicated she needs to go live with her mom full time or she's leaving . New wife is basically saying it's her or my kid, I get my kid needs work and I'm trying to get her to do chores and not have an attitude I've made appointments with a therapist to try and see if he can help but my new wife isn't having it, she doesn't even want to try anymore. My kid is only 15 and I'm not just going to throw her out or give her to her mom full time, I'm contemplating divorcing my new wife.  Is this unreasonable?"
1k1csva,My wife wants her brother to stay with us,"So my wife has a brother who got out of jail 2 years ago after being in prison for over a decade for some pretty serious charges including rape and murder,though he didn‚Äôt pull the trigger from my understanding.

He‚Äôs getting evicted from his apartment and had his car repossessed and now my wife says he has to come live with us and is not taking no for an answer.  I told her from the beginning that under no circumstances did I ever want him even coming around my daughters or my house and now she‚Äôs not giving me a choice and says I‚Äôm not being understanding and selfish but I have kids to think about. I wouldn‚Äôt want him living with us anyway even without the kids to be honest but I really can‚Äôt have him around my daughters .  What should I do?"
zwioex,My [25F] husband [28M] reacted poorly to someone breaking into our house last night and I am looking at him differently.,"What would you do in this situation? I was woken up around 7AM this morning to my husband asking ‚Äúdid you bring someone here last night?‚Äù To which I replied ‚ÄúNo. what are you talking about‚Äù. He said ‚ÄúWe have a weird situation, there‚Äôs a stranger in the house.‚Äù 

So I was freaking out and jumped out of bed. I went in the living room and there was a women in our living room crying saying she didn‚Äôt know how she got here. Mind you, we have a 4 year old who sleeps in his own room. 

Apparently she had been here all night sleeping on our couch. So I‚Äôm freaking out and telling her I don‚Äôt care how you got here or why, but you need to leave, now. Well apparently my husband had offered her a cigarette and let her go on our deck to smoke. And then proceeded to tell me he was going to give her a ride somewhere. I was literally begging him not to. I told him it was dangerous and to please not. He said directly to me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do it.‚Äù 

So I called our landlord who lives directly under us and asked him to check him cameras that he has outside to see when she might‚Äôve broken in. He left work and rushed here. While we were waiting for him to get here, I left the room to get something and two seconds later my husband comes in the room. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwtf are you going? You can‚Äôt leave the baby alone with her in the other room.‚Äù Like where are your protective/ survival skills? 

When our landlord got here he approached her very assertively and was asking a bunch of questions and asked us if we wanted to call the cops. I said yes, despite knowing my husband did not want to. So the cops come and decide to take her to the hospital. It was definitely a mental health and/or drug situation. Which I can sympathize with, but ultimately she broke into our home and I am so shaken up I want to move immediately. 

I don‚Äôt even want to sleep here tonight. Anyways, my question is, am I over reacting by looking at him different from this situation? I feel like he was so nonchalant about the situation. It could‚Äôve been way worse and his response as to offer her a cigarette and a ride. I‚Äôm just mind blown and not feeling safe at all. What are your thoughts? What would you do in this situation? 

EDIT TO ADD: I posted this in the heat of the moment and obviously I am not going to leave my husband because of this. I just wish he reacted in a more protective manner and asked her to leave rather than give her the opportunity to harm us. I‚Äôve always appreciated his empathy towards people but I think the safety of his family should‚Äôve came before a home intruder. Something like this has never happened to me. This is quite literally my biggest fear and he knows that.

Edit #2 to add: Wow. After reading someone of these comments I am shocked at the amount of people calling me a psycho and crazy because I was upset someone literally broke into my house. 

No where in my post did I say I was confrontational, angry, aggressive or even slightly violent. All I did was calmly ask her to leave my house immediately. I didn‚Äôt threaten to call the cops to have her arrested, nothing. I simply went into another room with my son and called my landlord and asked him to check the cameras to make sure no one else was in my house and to see what time this happened. I had zero intentions of having her arrested. 

My landlord and I agreed to call the police to get her help. We all agreed we weren‚Äôt even going to tell the police that she broke into my home. We told them she knocked on my door and asked for help. In no way did I want her to get in trouble. I wanted to get her help. I just wanted her out of my house and away from my kid like any REASONABLE person. 

I‚Äôm the type of person to give money to homeless people every-time I see them, donate clothes, volunteer and advocate for people who struggle with mental illness. As I said in my first edit, I obviously am not going to leave my husband after this. My frustration comes from the fact that I wanted her out of my house. Period."

1k7umkb,"My brother is a huge creep, how do I get my parents to take that fact seriously?","My (14F) brother (15M) has down syndrome and is a creep to me, my friends and my family. I myself have met so many wonderful,kind,responsible kids and adults with down syndrome, and the intent of this post is the opposite of wanting to demonize/infantilize people with disabilities.

Since we were little kids, i remember my brother being weird to me and my female family members. He would always touch my grandmothers and mother on their chests and talk about their privates. For a more specific example, when i was ten, one time he pinned me down the couch when we were playing like normal kids and tried to kiss me on the mouth. I was terrified and slapped him so hard that i popped a zit on his face and made him bleed. I probably had less than a second to react. My mom didn't see it all unfold and only saw the blood so she yelled at me, i didn't tell her what he did because i felt so disgusting and guilty for it all.

Another time 2-3 years ago i was getting dressed in my own bedroom and he walked in. He never ever walks into my room unprompted. I don't know what to do so i just curl up into a ball to cover my chest and SCREAM at him. I tell him to get out and he doesn't, he just stands there and stares so i eventually just start screaming my lungs out and crying, no words. I was there for at least a minute before my mom comes and gets him. I get no apology no nothing. I don't know if she thought about it for even a second that it is wrong that her own son was STARING at her daughter while she was completely naked, i have no idea how she would be ok with that. There was zero punishment for him. A few months ago, I asked her if she remembered him doing this  and she said no.

Lately, it's been worse. It's getting warmer so ive been wearing summer clothes. AGAIN, i am a teenage girl, i should be allowed to dress like a normal teenage girl without my brother of all people being weird about it. Today, i was wearing a tube top that covers my stomach and a pair of loose linen pants. I don't dress crazy at all. I love this outfit so much and i was so happy in it but he was just obviously staring at my chest and butt and saw no problem with it. I wanted to crawl out of my fucking skin and i've been hiding in my room for hours.

In the last few years, the times that my female friends have come  over, he ALWAYS did something awful. I try to keep my friends and my brother away from each other at all costs because otherwise, i have to be on my toes to make sure he doesn't do anything to them. When i cant avoid it and i'm hanging out with my friends at home, my parents usually do nothing to stop him so it falls on me. I once told my mom about how i have to do this and how touchy/inappropriate my brother is around my friends. She said that she would talk to him about it but later admitted that SHE NEVER DID. I'm just so scared of him making my friends feel unsafe at my house. I don't want to lose them.

I told my mom how i felt about all of this recently, she never punished him for the things i told her about. I was a total mess, i was in tears and struggling to get my point across because of it. She seemed pissed and said that i should never hit my brother when i told her about the time he tried to kiss me. I agree, i never hit him nowadays, the closest either of us come to hitting each other is shadow boxing as a joke or just wrestling with our hands. And i understand her viewpoint, because as a mother you never want your kids to hurt each other.

But i feel like she doesnt realize that he was actually going to hurt and violate me if i didnt hit him that time when he tried to kiss me. I was also just ten. If any  neurotypical and able boy not related to us did something like that to me, my mom would be ok with me fighting back. All i've ever wanted is to have a normal experience with my brother. I still love him to an extent, i've never really had the younger sibling treatment because i had to look out for him in elementary school and i still have to sometimes. This sounds melodramatic but i never want him to be at any important events of mine in the future.

Especially when im an adult and the people in my life won't know or perceive my brother in the way my family does. This is cheesy but i've always thought about getting married and now i know that i wouldn't be eager to have him there on that day. He takes a lot of the focus of my family and even sometimes my friends when i have a bunch of them over.

I need advice on how to handle this with my parents and some outside perspectives/thoughts on my situation. Some advice from other people with disabled relatives would be greatly welcome. My brother does not listen well to words and usually  keeps doing something he is told not to do bc it gets a reaction.

TLDR: Disabled brother is a huge pervert to me and my friends and i need advice on what/how to tell my parents who don't take me seriously that i think that having down syndrome isn't a get out of jail free card for being a pos.


UPDATE:

I've been talking with a therapist about how to tell my parents that i need more space from my brother and that they need to address his behavior. When i told my mom about what he has done to me and my friends before she didn't seem too understanding, more like upset at me. Plan is to talk with my mom and my therapist so she'll take me more seriously. I love my parents but unfortunately I can't love my brother anymore. Being around him stresses me out so much and I just don't want to bother spending time with him. I'll keep you guys posted on how the conversation goes."
yjqh35,my moms bf strangled me with a belt knowing I have strangle related trauma,"My(17f) dad tried to strangle me when I was 13. Ever since then I've been very uncomfortable having anything around my neck. Earlier today I was sharpening a pocket knife in my room when all of a sudden I feel something around my throat and I can't breathe. I instinctively slashed at whoever was strangling me.

My moms bf starts yelling and I turn around still trying to catch my breath and see him with a bloody hand and a belt. He started yelling about calling the police but didn't since it would look bad on him. I'm fucking pissed off that he thought of doing that. He knows my trauma and still thought it'd be a funny joke.

My mom took my knife and yelled at me saying that I had no reason to think I was in danger and now I feel terrible. Idk what to think anymore"
14gfl8g,Pregnant (21f) from a one night stand,"I just found out yesterday that I am pregnant by a man I had a one night stand with. I missed my period and decided to take a test, it was positive. I called him, even though we haven't spoken since that night, and told him while obviously freaking out. He tried his best to stay calm and asked me to meet him out. I did, I kind of just cried for a few hours and we didn't really talk about many options other than me saying I wanted an abortion. He comes over to my house later that night, tells me he thinks abortions are wrong, he can't agree with them morally, and that he wants to keep the baby. He kept talking about how he was almost excited because this is his first baby ect.) I respect his morals, but also tried to reason with him that I am a stranger who he knows absolutely nothing about, babies are so hard (I have a 2 year old whom i coparent with my ex fiance), and we would be bringing a kid into a broken home. I made an appointment for an abortion this morning for the 8th next month. I haven't told him yet because I just feel so guilty like I am ripping something away from him, but I seriously could never imagine myself coparenting with him. We are also not financially in a position to be ready for this. 
I just don't know what to do from here, if I should even tell him, or what. 
Would it be wrong to go through with an abortion even though he is adamantly against it, and should i be finding some sort of compromise? I don't even know how I could possibly ever compromise. 
Any advice is so so appreciated."
13zfqvy,Getting Over Hatred of Women,"I am a recovering incel. I was never into the redpill/masculinity/pickup side of things but was DEEP into the genetic determinism/blackpill stuff. This was a few years ago and since then I‚Äôve moved on from it, graduated college and got a job that I love and am passionate about.

However, as the fog is lifting I realize that I truly have issues with women. Issues that predated my incel phase and still exist now. Deep rage and insecurity and depression. I actually clench my jaw and get a pit in my stomach whenever I hear/read women discussing their sexuality or preferences in men. I can‚Äôt handle even the most innocuous, passive rejections or disinterest without it ruining my whole day. I never, ever approach women or attempt to flirt. I can barely even talk to them or look them in the eye. It‚Äôs like I fundamentally cannot see myself as a sexual being that a woman would ever want, that this whole aspect of life is kept from me because of things I can‚Äôt control. 

I don‚Äôt believe that women can be good leaders. I truly believe that their judgment is clouded by catty social dynamics and the attractiveness of the men they interact with. That I‚Äôll be overlooked in a professional setting if women have power over me because I‚Äôll be judged by my appearance and demeanor instead of by my skills and accomplishments. 

Basically I still can‚Äôt see them as full people or individuals. They are a woman first and (maybe sometimes) an individual second. I‚Äôve been alone for years, and I feel like I‚Äôve missed out on my prime years to date, have sex etc. And I feel like the reasons for it are arbitrary and unfair. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to go down a path of increasing despair and anger. I don‚Äôt want to be alone forever. I want a relationship and female friends in theory but I can‚Äôt connect to or respect women in practice.

EDIT; To everyone who offered me a thoughtful, long reply or reached out to me or offered to chat in DM‚Äôs, thank you. The amount of comments is overwhelming to address each one individually but please know that I‚Äôve read and will continue to read all of them. I will make an effort to respond and/or reach out to those of you who offered or asked me questions. 

To those of you who expressed anger, judgment, etc. I don‚Äôt blame you. Men like me have been abusers, murderers, rapists and more. I‚Äôve never done anything like that and part of the reason I want help is to avoid that ever being a reality. I hate myself more than you hate me, rest assured. But I ask you to think twice next time someone comes asking for help to change, because what else am I supposed to do?

FINAL EDIT; I am truly overwhelmed by the response of this community. I will continue to slowly read, digest and absorb your words and will respond over time to many of you. Your messages and encouragement have brought me to tears. I truly hope that others like me can see this post. And I hope all of you understand that your kindness and openness have helped me today and will help me change in the future. Thank you. I will make an update post in this community sometime later this year."
1lpyp0w,Girlfriend goes for a drink one-on-on,"Am I being unreasonable in that my girlfriend going for drink one-on-one with a guy she doesn‚Äôt know made me uncomfortable?

My (26M) girlfriend (21F) have been together for 6 months.
For reference we I live alone and she lives 2 hours away with her parents. UK based.
Recently a guy (21M) she was in school with reached to her on instagram, saying he had finished university, had moved home and was looking to reconnect with people.
Her and this guy were ‚Äúnever really friends‚Äù (her words) in school, but they sat next to each other in a couple of classes and so knew each other.
It turns out that he is also looking to get into the same job as my girlfriend, they agreed to go for a drink.
My girlfriend tells me this beforehand and I say that I really don‚Äôt trust his intentions as there is no way he knew about her work before he messaged her.
Jump to there meeting and they go to the pub for a few drinks, one-on-one, just them, no other friends.
After she arrives she sends me a text to say she‚Äôs there, and then there is no reply for several hours until midnight, when she says she is home.
The next day when we saw each other, I tried to raise that while I know she would never cheat, this meeting made me uncomfortable. Her reply was that she doesn‚Äôt understand why.

I don‚Äôt want to control who she can and can‚Äôt see, but I‚Äôm struggling to get her to see it from my perspective. What is the best way to demonstrate to her my perspective of this?

Is it unreasonable for me to think that a one-on-one drink with this guy she doesn‚Äôt really know is too close to being a date?
